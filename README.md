## 1. Data - Webscraping

#### Webscraping Data from Tripadvisor.com
All data was scraped from [tripadvisor.com]. The ```tripadvisor_review_scraper.py``` file contains all the code to scrape relevant information needed for negative taste-driven review analysis. Additionally, the ```functions_tripadvisor_scraping.py``` contains all functions used in the scraper. Information scraped includes hotel name, hotel adresse, number of reviews, average hotel rating, written reviews and respective review rating, tridadvisor ranking and the distribution of reviews.



## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
The ```config.py``` file sets up the folder structure. When cloning the repository from GitHub, all the relevant folders are already in place. Nevertheless, the ```config.py``` defines the path architecture and makes sure it runs on each individual local machine.

## 3. Natural Languge Processing

## 4. Pedictive Analysis

#### Random Forest
#### Feature Selection
#### Grid Search

## 5. Final Results
