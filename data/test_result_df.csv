(Personally I wasn't keen on staying RIGHT in Picadilly Circus, but I did love that it was only a short walk to Covent Garden.) We were happy with our room-- it was very clean, modern, and comfortable, and from the 6th floor, you would have no idea you were right in the middle of one of the loudest parts of London.   However, we were traveling with our 12-month-old son and had requested a crib/cot in the room, which was provided, but we were really not happy with it. It had been set up with a folded duvet inside, which at first we thought was in there as a kind of makeshift mattress (which would pose a suffocation risk and be extremely unsafe for a baby to sleep on). We went to take it out to have our son just sleep on the mattress that is part of the travel crib (which is recommended), but it seemed like the travel crib was either quite old and worn down, or just very, very poor quality. The mattress was rock hard-- not just firm, but as if it was just slats of wood-- and had inch-wide gaps where the mattress would fold to be put away. It did not seem like a suitable option for our son to sleep on that, either. I brought this up to the reception staff when we checked out and they didn't seem concerned, but I would really encourage this hotel to invest in higher quality travel cots for future guests. Although we had an otherwise very positive stay, we would not stay there with a baby again unless they did so.…",0.0,0.779734717929314,4.499689247980112

79495,1,0.6359643132798948,Bay Tree House Bed & Breakfast,5.0,4.0,"We have stayed at Bay Tree Guest House 3 times in the last 3 years. The accommodation is of a high standard and the property is within 5 minutes walk of Arnos Grove tube station and a good range of local shops. The continental breakfast is very good.  However, the cooked breakfast is not the traditional “full English cooked breakfast” you would expect from most B & Bs as a matter of course, and whether you get it or not appears to be at the whim of the owner Jasmine.  The first time we stayed we were served a somewhat smaller than normal and limited cooked breakfast.  The second time we stayed the girl who normally does the cooking had not turned up and Jasmine told us she wasn’t doing a cooked breakfast as we were the only guests staying, but presumably as she didn’t want to be bothered cooking herself, and tried to fob us off with a continental breakfast.   She finally grudgingly agreed to do a cooked breakfast like she was doing us a favour rather than giving us with what we had paid for and quite rightly expected to be provided. This clearly soured the atmosphere over breakfast and spoiled our stay.  We confirmed over the phone that a full cooked breakfast was included when booking our 3rd and latest stay to avoid any similar shenanigans this time.  Consequently, having asked if we could have scrambled rather than fried eggs we were extremely disappointed, surprised and put out to find that the “cooked breakfast” when it came simply consisted of a small bowl of scrambled eggs between 3 of us and nothing else which prompted the obvious question from us “is that it?”  Jasmine yet again grudgingly agreed to provide the rest of the normal missing elements of the breakfast which she miraculously somehow had in her fridge.  Again our stay was marred on leaving by the feeling that we had been short-changed and taken advantage of.   We will not be returning a 4th time.

For being situated so well, it is extraordinary cheap. Other features: The furniture (a.k.a. bed, the tiniest of tables, small wardrobe, big mirror) is better than one would expect, especially compared to the rest of the room. Also quite ok: the bathroom as far as size (big enough) and tiles (especially on the floor) are concerned. And you get a small but nice flatscreen TV as well as your small standard-safe. We also had a small balcony (unfortunately without a chair) at our ground floor room. Nice for watching the fox which visited one morning. :-)  What you don't get: a minibar (which is not a problem for me), a warm bathroom (which is: no radiator in there, floor and whole room cold as ice; this year's February is exceptionally warm, don't want to know what this is like in a normal winter), lots of space if you have more than one suitcase and last but not least a hygienic and dust-free room. The biggest problems from my point of view:  1. No real radiator in the room, just a heater to plug in, which makes the air extremely dry. But you can't help but use it, because insulation seems to be too weak so the room cools down very fast.  2. On the other hand - and maybe that's why they use this heater - there was always a lot of moisture in the unheated room. In the morning the window was completely wet on the inside. This may be the reason for some seemingly mouldy corners in the room. 3. Old, worn, torn: carpet was nothing were one would want to put bare feet on, bathroom fittings were always dripping and with a layer of lime on them, really ugly, unhygienic curtains, missing paint here and there, loud and not properly closing door, strange, even louder noises from the bathroom (I guess when someone in another room turned on their warm water).  All in all I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to stay more than one or two nights; we had five nights and felt more and more uncomfortable as time progressed. For a quick overnight stay it might be ok. But don't expect too much privacy, as there is no ""do not disturb""-sign in the room - cleaning personnel will come, wether you want/need them or not.

At 4:30 I had to inquire as I had a meeting at Holborn at 5 and wanted to change. The room was ready, and no one bothered to let me know, even though I was seated next to the check-in desk.

If upgrades are only for full cash reservations, say so. No big deal, but I would expect a 'We value your Diamond Ambassador loyalty, but we have no upgrades.' Cool, I can deal with that.   Also, I left my bag with someone and was told it would be delivered to my room. When I got to my room, there was no bag. I called Beverly to inquire and she said someone would bring it around. I had to leave to make my appointment and ran into the person delivering my bag to another room. I told him it was mine, but he waited for the other room to confirm it wasn't theirs. I get it, but now I was just annoyed.   Let me say, I have stayed here previously, and it was amazing. Can't say enough about how great it was. But this time was not. The rooms are clean and adequate. And the breakfast and drinks were fabulous, but honestly, Kimpton doesn't seem to be suffering from a lack of staff, but rather too much.

This was a single room, its was tiny and cold. It was clean enough apart from the carpet which was grubby and there was a terrible smell coming from the bathroom drains. I returned home after work to find house keeping had been in and left the bathroom door open making the room stink of drains.

It was the lift, it backed onto my room and woke me up continuously through the night- including 3am when someone came back in. I asked on my return that day if I could change rooms as I really needed to sleep. The staff on the desk said they didn't have anything for that night at all but if I left my bag at reception in the morning they would put me in a different room when someone checked out. So after another sleepless night I pack up everything that morning and head down to find that the lady on reception knows absolutely nothing of my request the previous night meaning I had to explain everything again. This lady acted like she didn't believe me that the room was noisy.   Upon my return late that evening I had been put in a lower basement room - 110. This room was much quieter with regards to the lift but not with hearing other peoples conversations through the walls. It may have been quieter but it was filthy. There was hairs on the bed sheet, by this time it was 11pm and ill be honest I couldn't be bothered to go back to reception so i thought right Ill just strip the bed and turn the sheet over.... I did this to then find hairs on the mattress as well. The bathroom could of been cleaner and there was dust and cobwebs everywhere. This room also had no TV controller.

83193,1,0.9632281976960265,Comfort Inn London - Victoria,3.0,2.0,"Read the reviews a couple of months ago and saw nothing that would stop me staying at the Comfort Inn Victoria. Upon arrival, we noticed there was no ice. When we asked, we were told there was nothing available. We got a bag of ice every day during our stay at St George’s Tavern next door to ice an injury. All the restaurants we asked for ice were incredulous that any hotel would not have ice. No idea why the Comfort Inn does not but the fact is - it has no ice or vending machines anywhere. Need a cold drink on a hot, hot day? Go somewhere else. Our friends tried to find refrigerator or ice to store medication that had to stay chilled and were finally allowed to store in the food refrigerator in the breakfast area.   Other cons: 1) not a single wash cloth. 2) The bathroom door did not close. 3) The bed was lumpy with a heavy comforter inside a duvet cover - no other bedding available. 4) The shower door only opened inward and because it was so tight, a larger person would not be able to shower in our room. 5) The TV could only be seen in one of the 2 bedrooms and when operable by the remote, it pixilated badly . 6) No water was available except bathroom tap water (funny taste) without asking staff to go get us one which they graciously honored - but still you had to go to the main desk to ask. 7) The wireless internet was very spotty and kicked us out in the middle of doing a live Covid test. We could not do the test privately in our rooms because poor internet reception. Extremely frustrating!! 8) The breakfast was skimpy with the same foods every.single.day. Breakfast consisted of cold cereals, unpeeled boiled eggs, toast w/butter and jelly, yogurt, mystery meat with cheese, croissants, and various room temperature drinks. 9). The toilet paper was thin and poor quality. 10) Although our receipt says we earned our rewards points for the stay, 2 days later they still have not appeared on our account.  Pros: Great location near restaurants, pubs, and 1 1/2 blocks from Victoria Station. The lady cleaning the breakfast area replenished very timely and cleaned tables promptly. The man cleaning the rooms was very kind and did a great job. In fact, the 2 star rating is because the staff working at this hotel was wonderful to us. I think the hotel’s problems are due to a cheap owner who is very lucky to have a great staff working for him.…",0.0,1.192130030657795,3.1749019607843136

The soap dispenser by the wash basin was empty. The clothes rail hung directly over the kettle, definitely unsafe in my opinion. The floor was dirty-our socks & feet showed that within minutes of arriving. Everything was covered in thick dust, coat hangers, skirting, everything.

The room is hardly big enough for one person never mind two people planning to stay 3 nights.  It is not the lowest category room therefore I have no idea what something below this category must be like.  When I say tiny I do not exaggerate.  Please look at the photos.  A one night stay would be almost acceptable if you were a business man on your own but not if you wanted to work in your room.  There is no desk.  The door into the shower room has been divided in two as a full size door would not be able to be opened as it would get in the way of the bed.  There is nowhere to put your suitcase.  There is a half size wardrobe which does not even allow the hanging of a man’s shirt properly and obviously no way can you hang a ladies dress in it. No drawer space other than in a very small bedside cabinet.  Again see photo.  No dressing table ladies so don’t expect to style your hair sitting down.

The hotel is located in a fabulous position, a few minutes walk from The Kings Rd, Sloane Sq, Knightsbridge and the glorious V&A, Science and Natural History Museums.  All staff encountered were professional and friendly making us feel welcome.  The hotel itself is quite grand and plush which is lovely and the roaring fire in the lobby was very welcome as it was incredibly cold outside.  Sadly, this is where things started to decline. We were taken in an incredibly small lift by a lady in housekeeping to the 3rd floor. Upon alighting we were led up 2 flights of stairs along a small landing and then down a further flight of stairs to our room. The room itself was lovely and spacious however proved to be style over substance.  There was no kettle or tea/coffee making facilities, we did mention this and a tray was subsequently provided however this should really be standard in a 5* hotel. Sadly, we had to ask for milk as none was provided and then we realised we had no coffee only tea.  The bathroom certainly had issues, a broken toilet roll holder and a circa 3ft wall separating the loo from the bath. This in itself is fine however made turning the bath taps almost impossible as you had to lean in the length of the wall to reach them. Once achieved, the taps proceeded to flood the shelf they were joined to. There was no hand held shower attachment which meant you either stood up to wash your hair from the overhead shower or use a tumbler from the sink. I should add however that the complimentary toiletries were of a very high standard.  At the time of our visit the hotel did not hold an alcohol licence which was disappointing. The licence been applied for but it may be worth checking with the hotel before you book.  In summary I would say that if you are looking for a fabulously located hotel and have the budget for a 5* hotel then take a look. A cautionary note would be to say that if there are any mobility issues or a lot of luggage specify you need a room on the 3rd floor or below.  …",0.0,0.9819689600739694,4.304761904761905

Things only got worse from there.  To access floor 2 you have to go up the rundown threadbare stairs then along what can only be described as tiny maze like shabby corridors (not wide enough for 2) until you stumble upon the tiniest lift ever. Even this has the same awful carpet on its walls that the stairs and corridors have. Up to the 2nd floor our room awaited. Fortunately we were straight out to an event and didn't have time to see many of the horrors that would be evident.  Can i firstly say that we are far from fussy so what follows is an honest and not nitpicky review of room 226  Bedroom for a delux double it is small but its fine for what you need for a couple of nights. This room is in dire need of redecoration and the walls are filthy and stained.  Even the bin is all dented.  The furniture is all chipped and marked.  The windows are old lose and rattle.  One you can't lock as the lock screw is missing so i highly recommended you put any valuables in the safe.  The room was 36° when we arrived. The air con did work for a little while (although it turned itself off after 30minutes) until it started pouring out water on the floor.  Bathroom The tap is disgusting, the plug doesnt work as you can't open it once shut. The sign says the water isn't drinkable but there's no bottled water available.  The tiles on the floor are cracked and we noticed tiny ants in there the second night.  There is nowhere to put the shower head so you have to hold it while showering, that is if you can turn the cold tap on enough to avoid being boiled alive.  They provide 1 tiny bar of soap and a pot of body wash on the wall of the shower so if you need shampoo or conditioner then you'll need to bring it (hotels we've stayed at have always provided these).  Managment leave a note on your room to say your room will be serviced Tuesday and Saturday... Needless to say it wasnt!!!  We challenged the state of the room the first morning and the chap on reception wasn't bothered.  I told him there were many problems with the room.

This review covers the following areas:   Location: Located close to Hyde Park, this hotel boasts of good transport links, swanky restaurants close by and 6 minutes drive from Oxford Street or Knightsbridge.  The Hotel: Despite the current pandemic, the hotel has kept it's very high standard of operation and service to it's customers and our visit was no exception.   Rooms: We initially booked a suite with a terrace and on arrival were upgraded to the Mayfair suite which gave us stunning panoramic views of Park Lane which was a nice touch to our stay, Tomas our butler for the evening was very gracious and warm towards us and attended to our every request during our stay. The room was fully decked with Large flat screen TV's ambient lighting, separate lounge sleep and bath area, minibar. I must say that we lacked nothing in our suite   - bed was very comfortable, as were all pieces of furniture in the lounge area. Bathroom came with a standard sized bath and shower and the mirrored effect added that wow factor to the suite (despite my almost crashing into the doors everytime I visited the bathroom :-))  Prices of the suite are on the high side, so be might not be in line with everyone's budget, but for that special treat why not?  Food: Food is very good as you can make your orders by making a selection from the on screen menu (from the TV) or visiting the restaurant on the ground floor. On the other hand you can pop out and enjoy from a variety of other restaurants around Park Lane (45 Park Lane comes to mind), but on the whole you can't go wrong with the hotel's selection of food.  Service:  I had called a few days earlier to arrange for a room that could be decorated for my wife's birthday , even at short notice the hotel events planner pulled out all the stops to ensure that the decor/room (even though I was on a tight budget) were achieved and delivered beyond my expectations...Thank You Farah, you made my wife very happy and quite a memorable birthday celebration.  All in all this hotel has everything going for it, but in my opinion, it's the staff who go over and beyond to ensure that their customers have a memorable stay by providing world class customer services and is up there with most of the hotels I've stayed in.

Our twin room was renovated, quiet and reasonably equipped, unfortunately with no  international type power or USB sockets for charging the mobile devices; Primark at Marble Arch sells adapters for 6 £. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom, storage space was adequate for our weekend trip while insufficient for guests with several suitcases. The breakfast buffet had a nice spread while the dining room in the basement is gloomy and cramped. Staff was friendly and helpful.  I don’t give this one five points for being an excellent hotel – it’s not. The selling point is the reasonable price tag for acceptable lodging near central London.…",0.0,1.1320509059229142,3.326643598615917

David was an incredibly gracious host from the moment I set foot in the door, and I enjoyed our conversations over breakfast more than any other part of my trip to London - which is saying something, because I had an amazing four-night stay. The hotel itself is magnificent, and walking from room to room feels like moving through a beautiful dream. David’s design talents are on full display here, and if you book a stay at 40 Winks I’d highly encourage you to ask him for a guided tour. He really is what makes the place, though. Not only is he very welcoming, he’s also wonderful to talk to and genuinely interested in engaging with his guests. True to the ethos of the place, staying here feels less like being at a standard ‘hotel’ and more like spending a night (or three, or four, as I would strongly suggest you do) with an eccentric family friend who’s full of fascinating stories and as comfortable talking about the best restaurants in London as he is discussing history, philosophy, and the character of the human spirit.  In terms of location, 40 Winks is very convenient to Spitalfields and Shoreditch, so if art galleries, restaurants, and thrifting are your thing, this is a very good place to be. It’s also quite convenient to the Stepney Green and Aldgate Tube stations, so if you’re hoping to travel more broadly around London that’s also quite easy to do - although I really would recommend you take some time to explore the area. I’d also recommend you ask David about places to eat and things to do, or check the relevant sections on his website.

Unfortunately my stay was in room 4, which meant there wasn’t much in the way of quiet,..  The positives - the Foundation is beautiful, my check in was warm and Victoria was lovely and keen to show me the gems of the establishment. Breakfast was decent and the staff were friendly. It was easy to access just off the DLR. Parking is available which is a rarity.  The cons - I do implore management to stay one night in room 4, after which they might make some drastic changes. The main issue is the noise of the DLR trains and road which is inescapable until midnight, when the trains stop. It’s not just the noise - I had enough foresight to bring earplugs - but the room shakes when they go past and they are so regular that there’s no falling asleep in between. The curtains are cream and have no blackout quality to them at all, which means the room is lit up at night owing to the streetlight, and then the room is fully lit from 5am as the sun rises - so I go approx 5 hours sleep the whole time I was there. The room is basic and prone to breaking - my sink plug didn’t pop back out whilst I was there and the bathroom needed a good lick of paint.   For the price, I can forgive the basic nature of the room, but I was charged £100 to have a really bad nights’ sleep. I’ve seen responses on here saying that you can upgrade to a more peaceful room, but I think it’s disingenuous to sell a room knowing how poorly set up it is for retreat when the hostelry is in itself a retreat. I was also travelling on a work expense budget so was not able to spend more money.  I would stay here again but would probably be a bit more vocal about room choice. If you choose to stay here and go for the cheaper rooms bring an eye mask and ear plugs - you’ll need them.…",0.0,0.6822336535406527,4.610241820768136

My sister and I were sharing a room with twin beds.  The size of the room wouldn’t have been an issue if we’d been spending a night or two; however we were spending a week.  There were no drawers for clothes so it was necessary to live out of the suitcases.  We needed more hangers (two women many clothes) so called the front desk and they politely said they’d have them sent up.  We had to ask again the following day before any arrived. Our room was pleasantly decorated, and faced the front street.  That turned out to be a problem due to street noise.  We were on the 4th floor and the 5th floor had a VERY squeaky floor.  I don’t really think the people above us were being all that noisy but every time they moved the ceiling in our room would squeak.  I wondered if the people below us thought we were being noisy. There was no hotel information in the room.  We had trouble using the phone and when calling the front desk were frequently met with no answer. The remote for the television was nowhere to be found.  We asked and were given one.  I found the original one 2 days later under the bed. Our second day we were surprised to find the room hadn’t been made up while we were out.  In the late afternoon a housekeeping manager(?) knocked and asked if our room had been serviced.  When I said it had not he asked me why.  Um, I don’t know?  I told him we just needed fresh towels which he provided. On the third day we asked for shampoo as none had been provided.  Bathrobes showed up on day 3.  The bathrobes were well worn as were many of the towels.  Coffee wasn’t replenished daily.  At check in we were not told that it was necessary to make reservations for tea or dinner.  The bar didn’t open until 5 PM and was closed one evening for an event. Breakfast was included in our stay and was very good.  We had lunch in the restaurant one day and it too was quite good.  Some of the staff in the restaurant were rather abrupt and getting coffee sometimes took time but they were quite busy. Our tour group had 60 people staying at the hotel.  One morning we had a very early departure time but the restaurant refused to open 30 minutes early so we might have breakfast. The decorating of the hotel is pleasant and I enjoyed the different collections on display.  The layout is odd with the lobby restrooms being a floor below the lobby.

They had toasters and a panini press which made great sandwiches that we took with us the morning we had to leave early.

When we returned in the early hours we realised the extent of the horror. Not only was the carpet badly fitted and a trip hazard it was very stained. The toilet was awful with unpleasant stains and a badly stained shower. The bed cover on the single bed was disgusting and covered in stains that could only be seen when pulled back.

The room 106 was tired, grubby and in desperate need of refurbishment. We raised this with our booking agent Booking.com who said they would make the property aware. We were nervous in doing this as we knew it would be difficult to find another hotel to accommodate us at short notice and had no real choice but to stay. I was asked to provide photographs which I did snd advised the manager had been informed. Nothing happened, nobody spoke to us and nobody offered a refund or discount.  We were all so disappointed with the quality and standard of the room. The carpets were filthy and stained as was the soft furnishings and bedside cabinets so much so we dare not empty our suitcases and left our wedding attire hanging in the suit carriers. The electrical appliances PAT testing stickers expired in November 2020. Our bedside lamp was broken and could not be turned on. The towel rail in the bathroom did not work and the fitting to broken that exposed a live wire. The lampshades all covered in dust and cobwebs. The windows were filthy dirty and the paintwork chipped and down to bare wood and also grubby. The curtains were poorly fitted and creased. The bathroom sink soaked you as the pressure was too great for the size of the sink. Their was mildieu on the ceiling, walls and grouting. The floor grouting looked dirty too. The whole place lacked any attention to detail and was tired snd long overdue a refurbishment. The halls and staircase smelt stale and unclean snd carpeting in need of a f cleaning. The staircases throughout are very steep and uneven. We did not eat in the place due to the poor standards of cleanliness. I will say the bed laundry was clean and comfortable and the staff we met were polite. Very disappointed with our stay and especially as this was meant to be a treat for the family but instead ended up being an apology and a grin snd bare it experience which we would not like to repeat.

54327,1,0.5,easyHotel Paddington London,3.0,1.0,"So, I’ll start with the positives (this section won’t last long but I am going to do my best to be fair and balanced).  The chap on the front desk was polite and helpful. The towels were clean, as was the bedding. The location is fantastic - like literally if you’re travelling through Paddington and visiting the centre, the location couldn’t be much better.   Now the short version of the negatives.  The floors were disgusting, the bathroom was microscopic and it smelt generally unclean.   The negatives continued…  (for those of you with more time. If you’re still considering booking after reading the above, for your sake… read on)  The AC didn’t work and whilst I wasn’t expecting a budget hotel to have a sauna, overnight my room spontaneously turned into one, lucky me!   The floors: Don’t wear white socks and don’t brave going bare foot; just don’t. Also don’t put your feet on the white bedding after having walked around the room, it’ll make you feel icky. Like really icky. Do not let your towel touch the floor (I cannot stress this enough!). Honest praise to the cleaners, I have no idea how they change the bedding without getting any of the general floor filth on it.   The microscopic bathroom: So another reviewer has done us all a favour and used a shoe to scale the bathroom. Needless to say it’s lucky most people only have a maximum of two feet because there’s little space for a third shoe. Im not the smallest guy, but far from the biggest, and turning in the bathroom was not optional for me. I didn’t wash my legs in the shower because, you guessed it, there wasn’t space to move around enough. I guess having a shower is somewhat redundant if you have at any point touched the floor after or allowed your towel to touch the floor, but hey, at least we tried. For this next ramble I’m going to assume all of the white marks that looked like they belonged on an episode of CSI were ‘toothpaste’ (I am telling myself that so I can sleep again). I’m not sure how to describe what was all over the walls, doors, mirrors (and presumably), floors, but I’ll try.   Have you ever tried to brush a disobedient dogs teeth? With them spraying toothpaste left right and centre?  Well this looked like the canine cast of 101 Dalmatian’s had all dribbled and spat their toothpaste over the walls. To cut a long story not so short, it was everywhere and evidently hadn’t ever been cleaned.   The bathrooms microscopic… continued. The drain in the shower tray was blocked (or maybe the water we were using just wasn’t to scale) so showers needed to be short, at risk of accidentally cleaning the floors by flooding the place. During my short and generally unpleasant shower I also noticed a few eye level pubes on the walls. I genuinely have no idea how they got over 5Ft up the wall but thought I would mention it to help you gage the cleanliness.   The noise… well at around 3am there was no noise, not even the AC… You could have heard the beads of sweat rolling down guests faces as they sweated the night away in their involuntary saunas. At around 6:30/7am though this changed. Don’t worry still no AC. I can only assume everyone was up early to go out and be literally anywhere else.   You could suddenly hear every guest on your floor, and their conversations, and their bowel movements. Now, I might have just had loud neighbours, but I imagine it has more to do with the doors and walls which are made of Papier-mâché like they were manufactured on an episode of Art Attack. Do not plan a lay in if you’re staying.  What else can I say…  My blind only opened half way. Some of the lights didn’t work. There was duct tape on the ceiling and covering over an extractor fan.  In summary: if you like hot, unpleasant, unclean, small spaces and all of the prisons are full, you might want to consider it. Genuinely though, the location is great (still trying to be balanced and fair)…   I don’t want to trash it to hard, because it is “budget” hotel and the staff members I did interact with were friendly etc and the location is great, but… It wasn’t so cheap, that you’d accept that the pavement outside had likely been cleaned more recently than the floor inside.   To quote Will McKenzie: “I couldn’t help thinking, a s*#t on the floor might have cheered the place up a bit”…",0.0,1.2248627269009824,3.1256085686465434

Without checking it before I made a last moment booking for other 3 nights over the weekend. I agree, the location is very good, but that is all. I paid for the 2 night 430 GBP and it was absolutely not worth it!. Every day the same, really very modest breakfast, the rooms are shabby and the bed/mattress very uncomfortable. As to the staff- the receptionist on the first evening was nice and helpful and agreed that I could stay in the  double room as booked for the first night, so it was nice. They didn't have generally many guests though and I stayed over the weekend. but still it is a plus. I will not mentioned a rather crass custom to pay  for the whole stay at the the check in, but maybe in the UK it is normal as the guests don't pay at the check out...it was not so bad but gives you already the idea what the quality of the hospitality experience would  be... But the check out itself was then really unpleasant, even weird and stressful I would say-  I asked the receptionist (another one) to have an extra 40 minutes (max) more as I needed to dry my hair in the room and she agreed, but nevertheless  different people (cleaning ladies and the very same receptionist by phone (sic!)) hurried me up. As I asked later the room was not booked for the next night... And just to avoid any misunderstanding as to my behaviour  I was always very polite and smiling and chatting with the staff, so there was really no reason to behave like that. Altogether, very bad experience! the quality absolutely does not correspond with the rather poor quality.

Adrian is the epitome of professionalism, always there with support, help and advice.  These men are gems in a sea of London hotels where no one remembers you.

So we had a coffee and waited.  After check in and collecting room keys we went into London. The hostel is on excellent transport links with buses from across the road to London Bridge , Tate modern , Victoria and Waterloo. The overground station is 10 minutes walk away.  There is a coop and a Nisa nearby. ( staff will direct you to the Nisa but I think the coop is closer and a more pleasant walk off the main road.) There is also a Chinese restaurant  nearby.  We had a four bed en-suite room.  The room was quite large as was the en-suite , a decent hot shower , toilet and sink.  With a shower chair and curtain separating the shower area off.   It was clean but tatty could go with a refurb but it all still works.  The toilet is loose and when you sit down wobbles slightly.   Beds were comfortable but mattresses are a bit thin and hard.  The room was a bit chilly probably because there were two large windows and one tiny radiator. The temperature difference was obvious from corridor / communal areas to the room.  There were two lifts only one was working.  We were on the 3rd floor so I was just happy one worked.  There are two issues to note  1. The dinner service finished prompt at 8pm and the only sign was hidden behind a door , not mentioned at check in and nothing on menus ( hence the trip to the Coop)  2. The noisy inconsiderate french school kids also staying on the same corridor who arrived back after 22:30 and proceeded to spend the next 40 minutes knocking on each other’s doors and talking loudly ( until I shouted at them having been woken up by them).  On both of the above occasions on speaking to hostel staff they were quite defensive, there apparently is a sign about noise on the stairwell door ( we were on the 3rd floor and took the lift so missed this one!!!!!)  I suggested they put a notice in the lift and on the corridor access door.   Being a concrete building there is little sound insulation and you can hear people moving about on all floors especially the heavy footed.   Breakfast is good enough but if you want something specific from the cooked food you need to say otherwise you just get it all. There is a good choice from the continental including cereal and yogurts.   Would stay here again because it has good transport links , the area appears safe enough but apart from the lovely guy who booked us in every other member of staff we had dealings with needs to learn to be more friendly, smile more and even if they’re don’t, should try and  look like they want to be there.

We asked about a kettle and tea/coffee in our room and were looked at as though we'd asked for free-flowing champagne. But, for 'our convenience' we could descend 6 floors and help ourselves to hot water in the restaurant/bar area. We were also told we'd been upgraded to the best rooms on the 6th floor. If these are the best, I dread to think what the worst are like. A pokey room with ludicrously ornate and over-sized furniture which covered the electrical sockets. In the eaves so we kept banging our heads and if we weren't hitting our heads on the ceiling, we were bumping into the furniture. Headboard of the bed so intricately carved that you risked injuring your head if you were foolish enough to lean back. Mattress was comfy though.   Then there is the Wifi, with very strict rules, only two devices at a time, which actually means that once you have connected with 2, you can't then connect another two. I needed to work, so that was useless - new daytime receptionist who had a bit of sense simply gave us another code.  Breakfast, also odd - took forever to be given some toast and a couple of croissants (which were good quality), but ruined by very slow service and, if you can believe it, cheap instant coffee that you have to make yourself.  As to the atmosphere, image you went to stay with some relations that you don't know that well and you arrive to find the welcome is quite friendly, but you are made to feel the the moment set foot through the door that if you cause the slightest ripple in their way of doing things, you'll be for it.

It was obviously older and there was some kind of bend or something in it, which made it somewhat difficult to get comfortable.  It wasn't so bad that we didn't manage it.  Breakfast at the hotel is yogurt, warm croissant and coffee.  We only did that once because the dining room just felt too crowded for us to be comfortable.  We did the full English breakfast at the restaurant down the street, which we did not enjoy at all.

Supervisor comes around after the room has been cleaned for quality assurance purposes. Very impressed with cleanliness.  Location 3 mins form Hyde Park is unbeatable. Easy access to buses and underground, most requiring no transfers to get where you're going (assuming your staying in touristic areas).  Lobby is nice.  Cons: Like (seemingly) most other properties in the western world, they are struggling with staff. There are some staff members who are absolute space cadets. There is no ramp to get your luggage into the front of the hotel, and when the two male front desk employees saw us struggling to cart our suitcases up the stairs, they offered no assistance. Just watched. Bozos.  They make you pay your bill upfront when you check in, which always makes me nervous.  In winter, the radiator can be very noisy. It gets stuffy in the room at night, but if you turn the radiator down or off it makes a terribly loud noise periodically that will wake you up and keep you up for 10-15 minutes.  The A/C works well, but be advised that if one person in your section of the building flips the master A/C switch beside the unit to ""off,"" it turns off for every room in your section. Then hotel staff has to go from room to room to figure out who the culprit is. That can be annoying.  Sound insulation from other rooms is not good, and if you face the courtyard, you WILL hear the family living in the building on the other side of the courtyard that yells at one another when they ""talk."" At least they seem to go to bed between 10-11pm.  Be advised that if you're arriving on an international flight that arrives in the morning and you proceed directly to the hotel, they charge 10 pounds each hour before the standard check-in time.  I found this insulting. We dropped over USD $2000 for the room only during our week here. And the hotel still nickeled and dimed us on a two-hour early check-in. It's not the money; it's the insult.

The hotel had a great aesthetic and some facilities including the gym, but nothing else.   We were first greeted by a trainee colleague who had no communication or customer service skills, but most importantly no one to help direct her. We were then passed over to another member of staff who was cold and not welcoming. We were also charged a £50 per night deposit for “food and drink” on arrival.   We were sent away till check-in which was understandable. Upon returning at the check-in time of 2pm, not one member of staff greeted us. We had to carry our bags up to our room despite being told they were in our room. The room wasn’t ready and was still being prepared, even though we came back after the check-in time of 2pm. The check-in process was long and at one point became confrontational. The room we were placed in was dark, had a window that wouldn’t open, and was an accessible room - nothing like the photos.   As a result we had now become frustrated and had to challenge the situation, despite not wanting to do this. We were apologised to by the manager and got placed in a different room of the same grade, and was given a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. We were told the manager would be in touch, however we never heard from them again during our stay.   We also found that someone had entered our room with a blank white key card after a night out in London. We found this extremely strange given house keeping had stopped at this point.   The experience set the tone for our London break. We are very disappointed with the service of this hotel and we advise people not to book if you want the 5* treatment you deserve. Employees were cold, and really need to improve their communication and service skills to make this worthy of its 5* title. At the moment it is not worth the money.   Looking out the reviews it seems we’re are not the only ones that have faced these problems either.…",0.0,1.0557864644869008,4.3984375
68337,1,0.7011865693541168,OYO Studios @ 28,2.5,2.0,I stayed here for a few days with my partner it was a surprise trip to London for me.... First impression of this hotel from outside. Nice and location great from Victoria bus and train station about 7mins walking distance...  Entering hotel reception area very nice and receptionist very pleasant I looking forward to seeing our room we were on the ground floor which I thought that’s good no stairs to climb.... Being older!!  Entered room I was very disappointed.  The wardrobe had the  doors taken off you could see the holes down the sides. On the wall was a small tv... No tea or  coffee.... The small table and a very rickety chair I daren’t sit on!!!!  The linen on bed was clean.. Discovered the bed had 2 mattresses top one was smaller with springs  the bottom was like a memory foam... sleeping was very uncomfortable the springs dug into you....  The bathroom basic with Shower the shower head was dirty and there was mould build up  round the tiles...  I had to put up with a cold shower no hot water in the morning....  The window and frames were  very dirty needed painting!!!!! if you left the curtains open people could see into your room through the dirt... The blind you could only pull down  1/4 of a way otherwise it fell to the bottom of the window sill which I experienced..... The walls were off white with some stains on them.... The only good part about this room was the free WiFi and Carpet it looked new... Shame the room didn’t match it.... This was a cheap hotel compared to some in the same area..  Maybe this is What you’d expect.. I won’t be rushing back.  …,0.0,1.3386985969470335,2.7079037800687287
73432,1,0.5310686992328266,St George's Inn Victoria,3.5,1.0,I went to stay here today.   Long story short. I had a message for early arrival explaining that it is subject to availability and you can pay £10 extra per early hour.   I first arrived to the property to check and  Sohnee ( front desk and lady how messaged). Was quite confrontational in saying check in was at 1:30. Which I wasn’t questioning I just wanted to see if I could pay the extra.   I came back at 1:00 ( half an hour before standard check in) to check again. Again more than happy to pay extra. To which she shut me down again. So I said that’s fine I just wanted to check as the message stated. To which she said what message and I re read it to her. At this point she was still really rude but soon offered to check with the cleaner.   This was the point I was annoyed as surely this should’ve been the practice from my second arrival instead of fighting it.   I don’t want to stay in accommodation where you’re being protested and I really wouldn’t recommend a stay here.   I would love the owner of to listen to how she spoke to me and change the customer service practice as it was extremely rude.…,0.0,1.257008036629937,3.2588235294117647

There is a nice selection of choice for the continental breakfast- coffee and tea are also available in the room. Fresh soap, shampoo and towels were brought in everyday, even if they didn't need to be changed. They were on top of it 🙂 The hotel is located in short walking distance to the subway (train), a pub, restaurant, cafe and convenience store. The bed was clean and comfortable, however both the room and bathroom could use a little fresh paint or updating. There is no air conditioning, but they provide a fan. Over all, enjoyed our stay and would stay again.",0.0,1.263177120738087,3.2
