6,0,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!,"Do not stay in this dump of a hotel, and I use the term 'hotel' very loosely. Borderline crack den. I cannot stress enough how disgusting this place is, and for a London Hotel, I must say I am appalled. The kettle, the iron we had, looked like they've been dragged through all the world wars... The shower, I mean, it's the first shower I'd ever been in where I felt like I was on the toiler at the same time. Almost certain me and my wife will end up with some sort of disease/rash due to the sanitation of the place. If buildings could speak, it would be telling you to stay on the street. It's honestly that bad. It's honestly, like a scene from a horror film, checking into a hotel that you'll never be checking out from. The staff, were non existent. No one was ever on reception, and when they were, I'd rather them not be. They were odd, strange, scary and very unhelpful.

10,1,"Noisy, dirty, uncomfortable","I should have read the other reviews. I'll give 1 star as the location was good.,   The top criteria for a hotel is to ensure a restful nights sleep and to be clean. I think I got maybe 3 hours sleep in a noisy, dirty , uncomfortable room .   The room was, to be blunt, filthy. The windows were black with dirt. The windows did not close , given the room was road facing (and a busy road) they should have been able to be closed to block the sound. They simply would not budge and I got very dirty trying to close them.  I asked the receptionist (when I found one) to see if they could do anything about the window, but they never bothered to do anything.  The bathroom was dirty. The toilet had been used and not flushed when we got there. The sink had a major crack in it .

11,1,"Basic, Clean. Value for Money Hotel","I booked for 3 nights and after reading reviews I spent a lot of time looking for another hotel but as I had already paid I thought I’d try it for one night and if it was as bad as I’d read I’d get a new hotel. However I’m not sure if the other teviewers stayed in the same hotel. For the money I was paying it was a lot better than I was expecting. Everywhere seemed clean, there was no obvious signs of disrepair . I was in a single room on the top floor which was the only draw back, the stairs are quite steep. The room itself is big enough and nicely decorated . The television was broken but once I reported it, a new TV was provided.

17,1,Death trap,"Looking for a convenient central London hotel with no high expectations. As others have noted ‘Opulence’ can only prove that the owner has a sense of irony. Rooms slight shabby, no air conditioning, but a handy stick provided to stop the sash window crashing shut.  But seriously, how did this place ever get a fire certificate? There is NO FIRE ESCAPE.

18,1,Opulence NOT,"Do not be fooled, this hotel is over described and I can’t imagine how it got its 4 star rating. Apart from the poor woman who finally appeared at reception and was helpful, nothing about the description of this hotel lives up to it. It is dirty, poorly maintained and definitely not to be recommended. Our room was in the basement. The curtains to the window which looked out on to some sort of storage area did not draw. We were suspicious about the cleanliness of the bed linen. The towels were grey and threadbare and the shower similarly unkempt. Don’t walk on the carpets in bare feet. In fact don’t let your feet enter this hotel. One uncomfortable night was enough. We will never return and suggest you don’t try the experience.

Even the Suite wasn't great everything is so tired and unappealing not sure this place has been rewired since Queen Elizabeth came to the throne as there were extension leads everywhere. The balcony windows weren't the most secure I have ever seen and the safe looked like it could be opened with a swift kick.  The whole place feels grubby.

I asked which would be quieter and the chap on reception said the basement, and I have to say it was quiet down there but quite hot.  The bed wasn't too bad but the pillow was very hard.  En suite needed some better cleaning and attention.  We only paid £85 for the night which for London is of course pretty cheap, so I didn't feel like complaining and it was only one night.

103,10,"Reasonable room, excellent food and a member of staff who needs a new personality","Summary:  This hotel is ideally located for London City Airport and London Excel all within easy walking distance. The DLR is a 5 minute walk with easy access to Canary Wharf and further into London. The rooms are of standard quality for a mid range hotel. Breakfast however is one of the best I have had in any mid-range hotel.  The rooms have plenty of sockets but could do with better soundproofing as your 6:40am alarm will likely be the British Airways flight to Ibiza.   Overall an ok stay.  Detail:  Checkin  Checkin can be done digitally for all Hilton Honors members and this process is quick and efficient. If digital is not for you, or your battery has died, there are some friendly people working the front desk. I was checked in by Chinx who was pleasant and, despite the fact I was an hour early for check in, did all she could to get me into my room early. This hotel has a very late checkin from the last hotel stay I was in, maybe this is a post covid thing. While Chinx was trying to sort out my room she phoned another member of the housekeeping team because they “had my room since this morning” and, although Chinx was trying to keep what the person was saying away from me,  I could hear almost every word.. Apparently they had an ozone machine in my room and it would need to be there for 3 hours… keep in mind this was 2pm.. The member of housekeeping she was speaking to was clearly giving her attitude and was unprofessional. Chinx, to her credit was determined to do the best she could for me and 10 minutes later I was in my room.   We did hit one hitch, the computer said I didn’t have breakfast included despite me purchasing an AP Honors Breakfast rate. Chinx sorted this as well.  The Room  I booked a King Deluxe room with water view. The promise was high that I was going to get a great room with a great view unfortunately this wasn’t what I got. I could see the water but due to the location of the room I couldn’t see to the left or the right very far. The room had an ok bed, a little soft for my liking but the pillows were nice. There was a reasonable safe and a wardrobe but no draws, except for the one’s next to the bed. The large TV was of an older design but it did what it needed. I think I would have liked it to be on the wall rather than taking up space on the desk. The tv cables were all hanging lose down the back of the desk and it felt like an after thought. There is an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe.  The promised bathrobes never materialised. The bathroom shower was large but very slippy when wet, a bath mat had been provided. The water pressure on 5th floor was not the best but you have good control over the water temp. Oddly the hotel is still using mini bottles of shampoo made of plastic which, according to the bottle is not recyclable, slightly odd choice in this age but better than a dispenser on the wall IMO. The biggest issue in the room is that it has next to no soundproofing so when the first flight of the day leaves London City the noise is loud. The aloft has much better soundproofing. The room has full AC and digital control of the room temp.  Breakfast  This was possibly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in any hotel, the cooked breakfast was hot, high quality and delicious. There was also mixed fruit, cereal, pancakes, waffles and pastries. The staff were attentive, always offering tea and coffee, and when I mentioned I wish they did Diet Coke they offered to get me some. Another example of excellent customer service.   Other observations: The premier inn near by has vending machines and you can buy a bottle of juice / chocolate there which is cheaper than the hotel bar.  Overall: It was an ok stay which was not the best for the price point (£200 a night) but with some real gems in the form of the food quality and staffs genuine desire to do the best for the customer, with the exception of the member of the housekeeping staff.…",3.0,Date of stay: June 2022,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London ExCeL,1499,4.0,605,500,220,97,77,0.45228215767634855,June,2022
104,10,A convenient base for London ExCeL,"We stayed at DoubleTree Hilton for one night after a day at a trade fair at London ExCel.  The overall experience was good. It was a nice little touch to be greeted with a lovely warm cookie at check-in. I checked in a bit early and that was no problem for them.  The room was as expected: A good size, spotlessly clean and well maintained. There was a kettle in the room with tea, coffee and milk. The best part of the room was the bathroom with a full size bath and with the standard toiletries.  We had first a drink at the cosy bar and then dinner at the restaurant. we were pleasantly surprised by the food. It was better than what you often get a hotel restaurants and reasonably priced. The maître d'hôtel was experienced, pleasant and efficient. The young man taking our order and delivering our food clearly was a beginner but corrected any mistakes quickly.   The breakfast was fantastic. There was a lot of choice, the items were replenished instantly and the quality of the all the items we tried was high. The best of all was the waffle, it was among the best we have ever tasted.  The only tiny complaint is that the lady who checked us out promised to send a copy of our bill via e-mail but I never received it. Still, I want to give her the benefit of doubt and say to myself that maybe I did not write down my e-mail address clearly enough and she was not able to read my handwriting. I checked the amount on my credit card statement and it seemed correct.  We would happily return to DoubleTree Hilton.

Despite proximity to the London City airport - very quiet. Restaurant - very nice for a hotel, though, predictably expensive. Also a nice bar downstairs. It's not advertised, but there is laundry service - also priced for a business traveller.  But I would ONLY recommend to stay there if you attending an event in Excel East. The reason: the area outside the hotel was a huge construction project that used to be a parking lot. There is nothing else there and nowhere to walk to other than Excel or DLR station.

108,10,Best service I’ve experienced in a London hotel,"I recently stayed at the double tree hotel next to the Excel for a business trip.  The location is ideal for the excel it’s literally a few minutes walk. I was taken aback by the planes landing, what appeared to be outside my bedroom window, but then realised London City Airport is across the water.    Comfortable beds, spacious rooms and clean.  The reason this hotel is getting a 5/5 rating from me is because of the EXCEPTIONAL customer service. The reception staff are just so helpful and friendly. I’ve stayed in many London hotels but this will always stand out. A special mention and thanks to Chelsey (hopefully spelt this nice) she was just so adorable, helpful and welcoming when I checked in!

It is comfortable, I sleep well, the restaurant is well priced and has a good choice and the staff are always so welcoming. Also the rate on this occasion was less than half that of in Town.  I arrived at LCR airport and walked the 10-12 minute journey to the hotel, easy without luggage. I apologised for being early and that I was happy to have lunch and wait as required to which I was delighted to be given not only an upgraded room, (King water view, rather than Queen rear view) and it was ready too. @Alexa was so friendly and efficient, telling me of the times for meals, providing me with a complimentary drinks voucher and inviting me to come back for some fresh cookies too.

Last night had a terrible nights sleep as the aircon appeared to be programmed to switch off every 30mins approx.  As unable to open the windows the room soon became unbearable without the aircon (the only form of air circulation).  Last night called reception about 3am they said there wasn't anything they could do remotely so I suggested it wait until the morning.  In the morning mentioned to reception who were very pleasant about the whole thing and said they would have it fixed.

The staff are all lovely, polite, and attentive, and the views from the rooms are just amazing.  I would consider staying here for a long weekend, as the path along the River Thames is just to the right of the hotel entrance, and there is plenty to see and do in the area, so it's not just a hotel if you are attending an event at Excel.

Despite close proximity the room was very quiet, although we arrived around 8pm so unsure if any flights actually were scheduled for after our arrival time so can't vouch for quietness during peak flying times.   Staff at reception very welcoming and accommodating, gave us plenty of very useful information regarding our stay.   The room was lovely, very spacious.

Check in was smooth and efficient and the room was clean and comfortable with all the amenities you need.  The bar was quite busy but one observation was no draught beer available, only bottles. Perhaps a sign of the times or a short term supply issue.  Breakfast each morning was of a good standard with a great selection, service of coffee however was quite slow.

154,15,Usual high standard but no beer in the bar!,"Close to the Excel, I was attending a conference but had to leave the hotel the night before to hunt down a bar with draught beer (they only had Guinness or cider on tap). And even then, after a £15.40 G+T on returning to the hotel, the bar closed around 11. The hotel entrance is the opposite side of the Excel and is not easy to access - the dockside walkway is uneven and you have to walk across the grass to get to the entrance. The alternative is along a road with no footpath or across the carpark. Not great carrying luggage from the DLR station (a good 10 minute walk).

DSEI.   The main access road to the hotel was closed and the security people did not know an alternative. We called the hotel 3 times and a person tried to direct us to another entrance. They were not a driver! After an hour driving around dock land we checked in to the Holiday Inn.   I called the hotel to cancel our non refundable booking and emailed them and booking.com of the the problem. So far all I have received from booking.com was a standard response.

Yes stolen! My car was the 3rd car parked from the main entrance and was in visibility from reception - see picture attached. Despite an outdoor security personal on patrol someone managed to get into my car and drive away.   I instantly informed the hotel staff/security and police and it was handled as if one had merely lost a phone! I was refused access to the CCTV footage, which is understandable - but the way this situation was not mentioned or even acknowledged during the remainder of my stay was beyond my understanding.

I'm a Hilton Honours Diamond member with typically up-to-a-hundred nights-a-year spent in Hilton Hotels so have a feel of what the typical Double Tree experience is typically like.    Frequently we get upgrades from Queen or King Rooms to Junior Suites due to status, but on our last visit (albeit during Covid-19) we got placed on a floor in-between a group booking of a large number of male guests who'd wedged their doors open, were playing loud music and communing in the hall outside our room to shout at others in the room.  I can only assume they were trying to occupy as many rooms on a floor to make housekeeping easier, but it certainly wasn't conducive to an anniversary weekend in London.

158,15,Great room but deposit not returned yet….,"Stayed overnight before a flight, room was as advertised, water view, large comfortable king bed, however no fridge (Hotels.com need to update their description!)  The thing that really has annoyed me is the fact that you have to pay a £50 deposit on your card (cash was not acceptable) and nearly a week later, it has still not been returned onto my card…..

Booked and paid for through booking.com but when I arrived they asked for a £50 deposit which I wasn't aware of to cover 'amenities and extra'.  Room 2 floor overlooking car park. Nothing special about the room, in fact a little dated. Corridors and lifts were needing redecoration with scuffs and scratches.  Double room was clean and as expected but the AC was SO loud, we called to complain as we couldn't turn it off, the manager said that this was the minimum ventilation requirements for the room so nothing could be done.

We had a dock facing suite on the 8th floor which was a good size and well furnished. We also ate in the bar and the food and drink was of a good quality, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall in the future we'd be happy to book a combination of this hotel and the nearby Hampton by Hilton when we need hotels near City Airport.  But beware if you have a room with a balcony. We stayed in room 842 and reception gave us the key for the balcony door when we checked in.

We both made gestures to say hello and the security guard just looked at us and didn’t say anything. We checked in and wanted to eat but understood that we had just missed the dinner which was fine as it was late, so ordered a take out.  Took the lift to the 6th floor and made out way to our room with balcony,and river side view. The view was exceptional, no complaints there.

I wasn't so keen on the rooms themselves which look like they haven't had a refresh in a while. The lighting also makes the room seem gloomy at best. Rooms and bathrooms however were a good size. Given the close proximity to the airport you would expect noise however the rooms are well sound insulated combined with the fact there were very few movements from the airport due to the COVID situation.

185,18,Not what it should have been,After staying here for 1 night with my wife I was disappointed. Checkin service was not good or i expected - had requested an upgrade if possible when booking but this was not offered or mentioned when i tried to check in. The room was tired. We ordered room service only to find that the one if the sauces in the pots they provided had been opened and half used. Poor considering the health situation at the minute. In future would not stay here but look at the other hotels in the area.

Got here and had dinner at the restaurant but the food was very disappointing, asked for half litre of wine as per menu and got given 250ml so had to ask for the rest which came in a small decanter, by the time I got to the end it had what looked like a peanut in.   I had a seafood linguine which was over cooked and the sauce was very bland.   Desert was the worst bit of the whole meal,  Rhubarb and apple crumble, it was soggy, had a horrible butter scotch sauce, apples tasted like they were from a tin.

Just a quick sightseeing of one whole and two half-days and two nights there between, in London. Last time in London we stayed at Hilton Kensington. Now we were travelling using money of our own, thus Holiday Villa Hotel was an affordable accommodation. The building is something ""Bayswater style"" (not new at all) and the lift had been mounted afterwards. However, it was functioning well to take us to the 4th floor. The room was large enough for two firm beds, writing desk and an armchair. The bath room was quite small, but there was shower available. The only annoying problem was the toilet that was adjusted to use such a small amount of water that the flush was badly incomplete. The rear window gave a grey sight, showing mainly the roofs of lower houses. But the hotel did not charge for this open view! The staff of Holiday Villa was kind and helpful, warm thanks to them! Possibly the best feature of Holiday Villa is it's location between City and suburbs. Just 400m to walk to buses 148 (Victoria Station) and 94 (Piccadilly Circus) and 600m to the Paddington Station.

207,20,A hotel to be absolutely avoided ! Never book this hotel !,"More than a month ago we were looking for a suitable hotel to stay as a family. While searching the booking.com website we saw that there are only a few rooms left for families. Because I had bad experiences before in some of the hotels located in London, I decided to make a phone call to ask a few question. We have a 2 year old baby and for his milk, food and water we needed a minibar inside the room. The indian accent receptionist answered my phone call. I kindly asked him if the rooms have minibar inside. I told him that according to his answer either I will make a reservation or not. He said there are no minibars in any rooms except some of them and he said he will be able to place one if we make our reservation to an Executive room. Depending to his word I made our irrevocable reservation via credit card. Before the night of our flight to london my wife told me that she received a message from the hotel which says that they can place a crib inside the room but not a minibar !!!! Again I made a phone call and same person answered. I said him that we made the reservation according to his word and now they are unable to place a minibar inside the room. He said me that he did not give any promise to me and Executive rooms do not have any minibar inside and if I insist on this subject they may help in in cancelling my reservation through booking.com and look for another hotel ! This is happening the night before our flight ! I closed the phone and next day after 4 hours of flight we arrived at the hotel. Although they have staff in front of the door, no body helped us carrying our suitcases, handbags and the stroller ! The person named Frank was not there. There were 1-2 woman at the desk. I told them the problem once more and again asked if our room has a minibar. At the moment someone was fixing the elevator. They told us to go upstairs and look at the room if they have placed or not! We enterd the room and that was the wors moment we had after 4 hours of flight and 2 hours of bus trip! The room was about 15 m2. Althoug we asked them a double bad there were two separate single beds, 1 crib in the middle of the room, and no space for our suitcases, no gardrobe for clothes and no minibar as well. I went down to say that the room is not suitable for us, it is small, with no double bed, no minibar and no gardrobe ! A woman from management or staff told us that we already entered inside the room and they are unable to change it as we used !!!! Used?????? You told us to go upstair to look inside and now you are telling me that the room is used. Without entering inside how can I know whats inside????? After an argument they again told us that we have a change to cancel our booking and look for another hotel. Because we were tired a lot I asked them to uğgrade the room. They agreed by £30.00 per night with a bigger room with a minibar inside! I paid £180 pounds by credit card just to relax. The room was quite big. 1 double bed but made of 2 combined single bed, 1 more single bed, 1 gardrobe, 1 crib without any matress inside (they think that child sleep on a wooden matress) and 1 broken minibar ! Water was pouring because the faucets of the bathroom were broken. The water tub was in rust and some parts were painted. All the windows were chained tightly so we couldn't open the windows and ventilate the room during the 6 days. The beds were under dust as you can see from the photos. The first day they were fixing the elevator and that day it worked. Next 5 days they placed a note which says that the elevator is out of order and please use the stairs!!!! Imagine that a pregnant woman or a disabled person stays on fourth or third floor will go upstair without the elevator ! They did not fix it for 5 days and no body came to fix it. Most of the customers fought for it ! Nobody helped visitors to carry their suitcaes to upstairs or bring them down ! Some of the staff at the front desk were extremely rude and cocky. Even one of them in a very rude way  said me "" What do you want us to do for you? We are not going to buy a minibar for you"" like I asked them to buy one for me. One of the hotel staff mistakely took me basement to give a different crib and in a huge area I saw minibar on the ground ! I am sure that there were more but they rather told us that they do not have any. The day we were leaving nobody helped us in bringing down our heavy suitcases. Even the staff did not help us in finding a way to go to stansted airport. They were totally  If I have a chance I give this hotel not 3 stars but -3 stars or no stars. The only positive part of the hotel was it was located so close to Paddington and Queensway underground stations. Otherwise totally waste of time and money. The next day we arrived to our country I made a phone call to Booking.com and sent them the pictures I took. After a long conversation they offered us a funny amount of £21.00 as the hotel management did not accepted to refund the amount of £180 excess payment. I kindly asked once more to have at least half ot it and they refunded me €100 as favor. If you are going to stay in London just look up for another hotel but not this one.

He sent a member of staff with clean sheets up to my room to supposedly sort the issue. I totally refused this and requested another room. There were no rooms available and they made no attempt to contact other nearby hotels to see if I could be moved. Ultimately, I had to stay on the sofa in the reception area until the check out time which is incredibly embarrassing. Also, being disabled, it has seriously hindered my physical state.

Walking distance to Hyde Park, accessible to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. You can even walk to Paddington train station, if you like'd to. Could give yourself a 10 to 20 minutes leisure walk to some Halal Malaysian restaurants if you are in need of one. Else, there are many other Halal eateries that equally offer you sumptuous hearty breakfasts, meals at affordable pricing. It is safe even at night, and can offer you a quiet night's rest.

Lovely old building from the outside. Slightly older inside due to the fact i don't think much structural renovations have ever been done. The rooms are cosy and clean but could do with an upgrade. The staff are courteous albeit a little under staffed. The adjoining restaurant serves an ok meal but if you want something excellent, head down to the Leinster Arms pub 100mt down the road.

Breakfast is poor with no full English unless you want to pay extra. Only toast really.

The guy at the front desk was friendly, the hotel itself is basic, our room had the hardest bed I have ever slept in and there was just about enough room to stand either side of the bed. There is no air con and the weather was hot so we had to leave the windows open all the time for air. Thankfully the bed was under the window. In future I would probably stay further away from Hyde park and just take the tube but if you don't like the tube it is only about a 5min walk to Hyde park.

The staff we agree can be very hit and miss but it’s a good base if you don’t intend on being in the hotel very much.

It's close to 3 underground stations and Hyde Park. I stayed in a single room (408) which was extremely small. The floor boards were very squeaky and I couldn't move without making a noise. The single bed wasn't the most comfortable one I've slept in and my feet were hanging over the edge (I'm only 172 cm).

296,29,An overnight stay including breakfast,The heating in the room was like being in the Sahara Desert. Although the radiator was turned off and the window was open it was still overly hot and made it difficult to sleep especially since the window was open to the noise of traffic outside. As breakfast was included I was looking forward to the start of the day with a good breakfast to start my journey. I was disappointed to find out that breakfast was limited to a 'continental' style which was pretty poor in respect that it was some cereal with skimmed milk only and some small croissants. The orange juice was also watered down and the overall dining experience was poor. If I wanted a cooked breakfast it was an expensive extra. This was not mentioned when I booked the room and when I asked the staff they did not understand…,2.0,Date of stay: January 2018,Holiday Villa Hotel and Suites London,969,3.0,95,261,288,152,173,0.7676348547717843,January,2018
297,29,Old and basic,"I arrived at the hotel with a friend at 12.30 pm. The receptionist didn't bother greeting us. We could not check in early so we left our luggages at the hotel. When I asked if we will get some tags for our bags, the receptionist replied ""you are leaving your bags at your own risk. we don't provide tags"" which we felt rude and make us feel insecure. We checked in about 2.30 pm. We booked 3 rooms and stayed for 2 nights. My room was OK, but my friend's room (which was more expensive than my room) was cramped with old carpet. The room was a standard double. However it had a small staircase which took away space in the room and the tea facilities was awkward to get to.

The hotel is situated in a good location almost across the road from Finsbury Park and within walking distance from the tube station, shops, restaurant and even a lively bowling venue. The reception had a large seating area in front and breakfast was on offer but we declined. We also had to pay a deposit to stay in addition to the cost of the room which was refunded the next day.  The rooms are small with a small but comfortable double bed that had no headboard, a double wardrobe with a shelf and hanging rail, a chair, a double cabinet with 2 drawers that had tea/coffee facilities on it and a small flat-screen TV above it that stopped working an 1 hour after being there. We did inform them and despite trying they couldn't get the TV to work again so they gave us entrance to another room to use but this room only had a single bed in so we could only use the room to watch TV then come back to our original room to sleep. It wasn't convenient but better than no TV in such a dull place.  The bathroom was one of the worse I've used in awhile as only had a sink and a bath with a hose to use as a shower within the bath. Damp and black mould were visible in places.

After paying £64.44 for one night in a quadruple room we were not expecting a lot and after reading the reviews was worried what we’d turn up to but we were quite impressed with the value for money. I’m not too sure what people are moaning for and what they expect from a cheap 2.5* hotel but I am rating this a 4 for quality of BUDGET hotel. Of course it’s not going to be perfect and luxurious.. you get what you pay for but for a cheap hotel to crash in you can’t go wrong and I would definitely book again if we were to go to another event in Finsbury Park!

The shower area was so small you could just about with arms at your side,spin round. The shower was disgusting.  The shower curtain was dirt with brown stains at the bottom and breed gems. The tiles where dirty. The toilet had stains in. Omg I can go on and on. The beds where soft a day felt like they had things crawling.  No bed or pillow protecters.  No tea/coffee facilities.

Breakfast was OK too but not worth £9.50 for a tepid and rock solid full English, but ate it anyway and set me up for the day.

There was no hair dryer despite reception saying there was one. We ended up taking the one from my parents room who were also staying at the hotel.

The hotel is 1 min walk from The Tottenham Hale Tubs Stop - lots of building works around the area at the moment and the hotel is hidden behind scaffolding. The hotel is a 25 min walk to the Spurs stadium but is it quite far out from the center of London and you need to watch the time of the last tube out of London.,4.0,Date of stay: October 2021,Premier Inn London Tottenham Hale hotel,669,4.5,396,172,45,17,39,0.3029045643153527,October,2021

Firstly I stood at the check in desk for ten minutes while the resident building contractor argued with the receptionist about rooms and numbers. Then having to endure the constant drilling,banging and noise from within the hotel which is an ongoing building site. To having the entire building site of workers being virtually  at eye level as the photo shows with every window in this hotel is not the best experience.

The other nuisance was the air vent making a noise during the night although it did stop eventually.  Service was good. They were accommodating when I asked for decaf in the room and friendly enough when I was checking in and out.  As with my experience of Premier Inns the bed, duvet and pillows were excellent.

The room itself was very clean and everything was there that we needed. The rooms were cleaned every other day but if we needed fresh towels or anything else you only had to put a card on the door handle and it was delivered. For us this hotel was ideal as bus transport links were right outside the hotel and Clapham Junction rail station was only a 2 minute walk away.

However, given the fact that you are unable to open bedroom windows the room can feel quite stuffy and so the air con is supposed to help this. It helped to a certain extent, however in a summer month like this the room still felt particularly warm and this meant that I didn’t sleep as well as I expected.

744,87,I thought I'd actually written a review,We stayed here in September and I thought I had submitted a review. However it hasn't appeared. It was shortly after the travel ban had ended and we were a bit like Guinea pigs. On arrival it takes a lot to get used to what with the social distancing rules and the fact staff get shocked that people can actually be exempt (that would be me). Anyway the staff were very pleasant. The rooms were very comfortable and we had no problems. Breakfast was excellent although it was obvious that due to the social distancing and non buffet rules they were understaffed (especially on the Sunday when the locals who had obviously enjoyed too many all you can eat breakfasts decided to go).

While the premier inn is on the Main Street the entrance is around a dark corner where lots of iffy guys hang out at night- and one of two during the day. Tonight there was a whole gang of guys at the entrance and my husband was warned by one other guest to watch himself ( he was milk going over to Tesco Express ) as one of the gang was carrying a hammer. My daughter is at Uni here - which is why we visit snd stay so often but in future I’m not booking here. I’m not willing to tick out safety.

The hand sanitiser didn’t work and we were told it was temperamental.  The rule that mask were to be worn was largely ignored and we weren’t told our room would only be serviced if we asked.  I presume this is not a terribly new building and it is starting to look tired, with a bent lamp and the card slot for the lighting loose and needed a wiggle to work.

772,90,Great for a family,"My Family and I stayed at Mitre House Hotel for seven nights at the end of April.  We had a interconnecting Family Room, which meant that our 18 year old daughter had her own room, and we shared a bathroom.  The rooms were simple, but immaculately clean.  The hotel staff were welcoming and efficient and the location of the hotel is amazing.  There are so many pubs, restaurants and stores to choose from, and Paddington station is about a 3 minute walk.  Our room was incredibly quiet, which we very much appreciated.  The pillows were also great.  My only complaint is that the bed itself wasn't great.  It was obviously older and there was some kind of bend or something in it, which made it somewhat difficult to get comfortable.  It wasn't so bad that we didn't manage it.  Breakfast at the hotel is yogurt, warm croissant and coffee.  We only did that once because the dining room just felt too crowded for us to be comfortable.  We did the full English breakfast at the restaurant down the street, which we did not enjoy at all.  The service was rushed - so much so that while the server was trying to carry two cups of coffee by their handles - it was spilled on me and all over the table.  Breakfast was not warm and we didn't have cutlery for quite awhile after our food arrived, and we never did get the juice that was offered to us, or the glass of water we asked for.  Perhaps it was just a busy Sunday.  If you are looking for a centrally located hotel for a moderate price, this will be just perfect for you.…",4.0,Date of stay: April 2022,Mitre House Hotel,859,3.5,173,360,215,66,45,0.45062240663900416,April,2022

For starters, it was at most a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station & the Heathrow Express.  Handy to many bus routes and 4 Tube lines, so transport to anywhere was easy.  Room was comfortable and clean and had a kettle for coffee or tea. The continental breakfast was substantial enough to keep us going.  The free wi-fi was reliable and strong.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  Kate, Helena, & Mina all went out of the way to do things for us.  Very good value for the price.

775,90,A Gem hidden away.  Wonderful Hotel,I would give this 5 stars if they had air conditioning.  We did not need it for our stay but in the summer it would be nice.  We had 2 rooms for 10 days the beginning of March.  Our granddaughters were in the room right next to us. The rooms were very comfortable and clean.  We had a bathtub and really enjoyed that.  The front desk was very helpful and gave some wonderful advice.  This was not our first trip to London but they still had some helpful tips for us.  I tried to see what people had complained about and could only say that they lost out enjoying a wonderful visit.  When we arrived a little early both rooms were ready.  To enter the the hotel the front desk has to buzz you in.  I really liked this.  The rooms had keys not the cards.  I dislike the cards because they are always messing up.  Yes you turn in the key when you leave and they give it back when you return.  I like not worrying about losing my room key.  The breakfast was very nice.  The days at the hotel were continental.  Due to COVID they brought you the food to your table.  I asked for cereal one time and they brought it to me every time we went down.  The weekends we went to a local restaurant for a full English breakfast that was paid by the hotel.    The restaurant was wonderful and the food was delicious.   Honestly if you wanted something you just needed to ask for it.  Wi-Fi was fast.  Location was quiet and close to 2 tube stations and Hyde Park.  Our rooms were always cleaned while we was out during the day.  We could not ask for a better hotel and we plan on returning.…,4.0,Date of stay: March 2022,Mitre House Hotel,859,3.5,173,360,215,66,45,0.45062240663900416,March,2022

I came back and my room was ready as promised.  I had a single room on the 4th floor which was quite small but my plan was not to spend much time in the room anyway. London is a great city and you won't spend so long in your room. Room was spotless if a bit dated. Bed was clean & comfortable and room was warm. Plenty of sockets around the room which all looked brand new. Breakfast came in the form of a voucher for a cafe around the corner (2 mins) which was absolutely perfect.

However, we didn’t book online we went in as it was easier. The place looked ok and the receptionist was very pleasant, she agreed to match the hotels.com price for the superior double room with breakfast and parking.

Parking is not very well designed,meaning all parking will be in angle and a fellow guest could scratch your rental car. Staff was ok. Was my first time in London and the English gentleman from the front desk was not very happy to answer questions regarding transportation.

The washroom facilities are a little dated, but also completely adequate. The price you pay is quite reasonable for what you get and what you get is more than fine.  Wifi was fine for us and the reception and breakfast staff were all friendly and accommodating. We had to turn the heat in the room down, which I find unusual for an English hotel.

From the warm welcome of the front desk staff - including Lino Leite - who checked me in to Audrea's attentive service during my spa treatment, I had a fabulous time during my holiday which was unfortunately shortened.   Lino welcomed me warmly upon arrival where the check-in process was quick, efficient and I was even shown to my room earlier than the posted check-in time. It was amazing to be able to refresh in the room after a 12 hour flight, before meeting up with local friends later in the day.   As I was on holiday, I decided to splurge with a Spa Treatment. The spa at Nobu Hotel is definitely a relaxing way to escape the hustle and bustle of London - if even only for a few hours. Though small, the facility is impeccably clean, relaxing and soothing. Audrea was my therapist who is simply awesome at her job! I had a body scrub and scalp massage which transported me to a very soothing, blissful place! I left feeling super relaxed.

885,101,Fun Week At Nobu Shoreditch,"We stayed for 6 nights at end of February, beginning or March. The hotel is lovely. Very warm and calming decor. The staff was wonderfully helpful and charming. The location in Shoreditch is perfect. A five minute walk to the tube, great coffee shops and restaurants close by and within walking distance. The neighborhood is lively and safe. We were so glad we stayed at the Nobu in Shoreditch an not in the more touristy areas closer to downtown.  The room lighting is a bit tricky to figure out. Ask for help if you need it. The bathroom could have used a bit more counter space. Those are the only negatives I could think of.

887,101,Fab Stylish Room - Unnecessarily Complex Billing Issues,"Stayed here on Saturday 29th Feb 2020, and had two rooms in my partners name- these rooms, as you'd expect from Nobu, were stylish, spotless, comfortable & had a really great ambiance. Worth pointing out that the view from both our rooms was of an air conditioning plant room and other buildings that looked into the room - not ideal BUT you are staying in central Shoreditch, so unlikely to see meadows and baby lamps, but none the less, worth considering asking for a room without this view if they have it.   The corridors into the rooms are incredible, as is the entrance lobby and the cafe area. Must raise that although it is Shoreditch, the corridors absolutely stank of weed - and I mean stank.

From the first email correspondence to Vasiliki the Reservations Agent to booking the Spa Treatment for Two package with Daisy, who immediately went out of her way to try and fit us in when she knew what I was planning. The treatments were then amazing too-some of the best I've had- the back, neck and shoulder massage and the facial. Bliss!  It took a lot of careful planning with it being a surprise proposal and the staff were so professional every step of the way but with such a personal touch and we felt so special anyway.

903,103,Rather underwhelming,"I took a chance on the Nobu Hotel because The Boundary was sold out. It was just plain disappointing. The location is great, but the room was small and uninspired. It felt more like a cheap Disney set than anything authentic. Don't get me started about the restaurant. It was obviously built for IG / selfies rather than anything resembling a good dining experience. Nobu Matsuhisa should just acknowledge he has become a brand rather than a chef.

The billing concept was a little bit intransparent (coffee drinks for example not included). The rooms were well designed and offered a great sleeping quality.

Alternatively you can go down to the main bar where the music is very loud and there is hardly any seating, so forget a relaxing drink after a long London day.  There are some issues with the electricity. The TV just turned itself off and at some point so did the bathroom light which left me in the pitch black bathroom (individual lights turn off randomly). The shower stall has no door, so you get cold taking a shower.  The room has no Nespresso machine/or any coffee machine.

939,106,More sushi than miso black cod,"I was excited about Nobu having a hotel only 1.5 miles from my meetings and was looking forward to the experience.  It’s tucked away on a quiet street In Shoreditch and vaguely resembles a yacht.  It has the Asian minimalist design you would expect with lots of teak and exposed concrete.  Design is pretty.  However, the hotel doesn’t quite make it.  It’s like the sushi at Nobu, passable but everyone dines at Nobu for the black cod.    The rooms have tiny twin beds that aren’t very supportive.

Yet, practically speaking this is the least intuitive hotel my partner and I have ever stayed in. For some reason, the hotel just doesn’t seem to “flow”.   The mirrors are hidden away in places where you can’t get adequate lighting and / or reach a plug, making it incredibly difficult to get ready. Similarly, the same lighting that makes the room feel soft and comfortable is simply too dark to get ready easily.

967,109,Stylish Hotel in the Heart of Shoreditch,I was in London for the weekend before work and wanted to stay in Shoreditch which is my favourite area in the city.  This property is so perfectly situated right in the heart of Shoreditch and although it is a japanese branded hotel in incorporated the culture of Hackey and Shoreditch into every aspect of its decor and personality.   The rooms were extremely spacious (for London) and the beds were the most comfortable I've slept on in a while.  With black out blinds and thick windows you can't hear or see the light from the outdoors which makes sleeping (even in this busy neighbourhood) very easy.   The food at this hotel is one of the reasons to stay here as the restaurant downstairs is one of the best in that neighbourhood if not the entire city.  Best way to try it all is…,5.0,Date of stay: July 2019,Nobu Hotel Shoreditch,422,4.0,253,82,46,14,27,0.22572614107883818,July,2019

This was an online booking and payment including the breakfast.  Our evening meal (not booked) was good.  Our self service continental breakfast was as you would expect.  It didn’t seem to be very busy at the time we stayed and there were fewer staff than I expected BUT boy were they attentive and helpful, some of the best I have come across.  The only thing I would mention is the parking.  It’s a small car park but we did get a space (£10 per night) and it was payment on departure, which is fine, however it is worth understanding that had we chosen to take the car out early evening then there would have been a charge and of course we may not have found a place to park on return, so all understandable really.…",5.0,Date of stay: March 2022,Premier Inn London Eltham hotel,501,4.0,263,116,50,29,44,0.33112033195020746,March,2022

Also, there was an industrial fan on the whole final night there, which we believe was centrally-controlled as we couldn’t turn it off and it was very loud and affected our sleep. It turned off the next morning. ",1.0,Date of stay: June 2022,Premier Inn London Eltham hotel,501,4.0,263,116,50,29,44,0.33112033195020746,June,2022

Also because of a very large group of foreign students, it was very noisy at breakfast on our 2nd morning. The only bad thing that we all agreed on was the WiFi being so poor. There is supposed to be free WiFi, but it was even difficult to connect in the communal area.

1004,113,Disappointment,We thought we knew what to expect when booking a Premier inn. We were very disappointed with the Eltham Premier Inn. Firstly the internet was non-existent on most of the 4 night stay. Also we were annoyed the staff allowed so many people in without masks. Then the bathroom extractor did not work we reported it and it was not fixed. The heating/air-con did not work properly and could not switch to cool air. Then the rooms were not cleaned or towels replaced for 4 days even though other hotels are doing it when the rooms are not occupied. The room had a connecting door to another room and we had to listen to the overtures of a very energetic couple all night and the next morning too!!!!.   All this discomfort at 73 years of age was not welcomed and we will not stay at Premier…,2.0,Date of stay: December 2021,Premier Inn London Eltham hotel,501,4.0,263,116,50,29,44,0.33112033195020746,December,2021

The terminal was out of action at the time we arrived and when we made a further later attempt to pay, received confirmation from the terminal that we had paid. A few days later I received a penalty notice. I submitted a very full account of what had happened and having checked my credit card account and seen that payment had not been credited, offered to pay the original fee. Within two days I received an email to the effect that my appeal had been rejected and that there was no excuse for not paying. They clearly had not read my email. Avoid!

1020,115,Not the nicest Premier Inn,The woman on reception was an argumentative person. She needs to go on a customer relations course. I don’t think I can recall ever being greeted by such a grumpy person. When we had an issue with the travel cot she decided to argue that babies will sleep anywhere so I should just tell my daughter that. The travel cot basically had a sheet wrapped around the cardboard casing and even if that is the policy for premier inn she could have at least waited until I had got back in the lift before moaning about me  to her colleague who looked equally as surly. Normally I would have challenged her but realistically we were going out for the evening and we didn’t want to risk anything happening to our belongings while we were gone.  Parking was a nightmare.

The only downside is that as well as being free from noise it was also free from any mobile phone/4G signal and the internal free WiFi  was problematic.

As another reviewer has commented, housekeeping really need to check the cleanliness of rooms.  Other guests were noisy the night we were there - many seemed to be teenagers.

1072,120,Do not stay in Victoria station hotel,"Posting on my friends account as I do not have a google account. I called Abe’s today at 11:59 for 4 wings and a side of curly fries. Was told at the time of call it would take 20 minutes. Okay fine. I arrive, I pay, I wait. Then I go to check on my order, and am told by who is working the register that my order will be out and done at 12:29. So with that, and with the trying times going on, I have 30 minutes lunch, I work in healthcare. Already had a stressful day, I am starving, can’t wait to try Abe’s for the first time. But being I only had a 30 minute lunch I had 20 to spare/wait and 10 to eat. So naturally I went ahead and canceled my order because I wanted to be able to eat something before I clock back in. As my order is canceled my food comes out. Mind you nowhere near 12:29. So not only is it poor communication amongst staff but frankly the manager just didn’t care. When I call back to ask when my refund will be issued I had the displeasure of speaking with DENISE, who says “you really couldn’t wait one minute”. That was the cherry on top. Not only did she not care, I don’t even recall an apology from her. Yes I yelled and cussed at her. But again I work in healthcare, it is very stressful and I was very hungry. Don’t let Abe’s fool you, the word “friend” is splashed all over the website but I would never be friends with a woman like Denise who can’t show new customers common courtesy. You may have good reviews and good food, but that is nothing without a good heart. Didn’t even offer me anything for my wasted time and her rudeness.

1073,120,It has taken me till March to write this as was so disgusted.,"This place has the cheek to call itself a hotel. If you read my other reviews from around the world you will see I am fair and try to see the silver linings. That was not possible with this  ""hotel"".  When we first arrived we waited in a cue of people leaving there left luggage to check in. These people probably thought would be secure but the hotel is far from secure. This can be seen in the picture of the wedged open fire escape. Couldn't get a picture of the reception desk was too cramped and rarely manned.  When we entered the room we were shocked. The smell of mould, was overpowering. We opened the window further it looked into a flat roof and alley. Outside the window we found needles and syringes. We went and told the desk this. The reply was ""we cant be responsible for what people do in our rooms"". Another problem was the lack of light in the room. They had to replace the dud bulbs. I will be honest the room was en suite but seemed more like a converted office or something similar. The pictures on trip advisor and there website are at best deceiving and worst a lie.   We were concerned for our security as outside the hotel wasn't the best. The window and loose lock on the door were an issue. The window was sorted by the desk staff jamming window closed and the door he said was ""PERFECTLY SECURE"" and assured that the desk was manned 24 hrs. This was not the case and even if was the fire exit open to our door negated that.  The breakfast was sparse. The bread left out for toast was hard and as sitting there they started to use the eating area for their luggage business. I feel sorry for people who think there luggage is secure.   We had a full itinerary so luckily only spent a few hours in the room at night. We only had to bare the smell at that time. Due to the security issues we kept all valuables with us and when in room kept a chair against the door. Two nights was the maximum we could manage.  As I have said we tried to speak with management. We were told there was nothing wrong and nothing they could do. Speaking with other residents found they had similar issues.  I WOULD WARN ANYONE TO AVOID THIS PLACE. At one point I did consider contacting environmental health. If had been a longer stay there.  Included are pictures of all the doors wedged open. The fire door open to the main road with no one their. The picture of syringe outside window.

1074,120,Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in,"Stayed here recently and NEVER AGAIN. After a fumbling check in I was directed to my room, once I’d managed to negotiate the maze of narrow stairs, corridors and doors I finally found my room at the very top of the building. (Room 11). I had been told this was second floor but was actually third.   Upon opening the heavy auto close door, as far as it would open with the chair pushed behind it and forcing my luggage into my room I was initially presented with a pleasant enough room. But that didn’t last long.  The room is very compact and I wouldn’t like to think I’d had to share and fight my way around with a partner. There are only 2 plugs in the room, and if you want to use the fan or the heater you are reduced to a single plug to use. Everything needs some TLC, from the scraped and holed walls, the tiny TV with a remote that bends as you press a button.  The ‘body’ towels were small and the bathroom was filthy.   If it wasn’t for my 11pm arrival I’d have turned around and found somewhere else.  Bedding wasn’t clean, and I slept on top of the duvet on two very flat pillows.

You kan make tea/coffee in the room which is tiny. But-they dont replenish what you use and they dont bother to do up the room.

The budget room was appalling, smelt of stale cigarettes despite being a non smoking room and when we mentioned it to a member of staff they did not seem to care just nodded in agreement. The tv did not work properly and there was no remote,  and the lock on the door was faulty. The standard room wasn’t much better, the bed sheets were clearly not changed as had black marks and stains on, the bathroom door handle was hanging off the door and the door to get into the room had a hole in.

It states that it has central heating but it actually has one of those oil filled plug in radiators which did warm the room up nicely but the bathroom was on another level of cold.   There were only two power points on one side of the room but they did have USB sockets in them which was handy. The hairdryer was good and there were several mirrors.

On the flipside it really is very much a budget establishment, we were right at the top of the building  (the receptionist said 3rd floor but we went up many more spindly staircases) and there was no lift.

There were plenty of towels and although it was slightly small it was perfect for a good nights sleep and thats all we needed.

What was even more scandalous was that they knew I was staying 4 months but they gave me the worst room ! They even didn't offer me at first the room on a higher floor, which is brighter.

I don’t remember anyday when i was happy with the hostel.  The hostel is less maintained. The lift doesn’t work most of the times and even when it works it is scary. You cannot talk here after 10pm as people living here complain to the staff which is why there is no privacy. You can listen people talk through the cheap walls built. Most importantly, the TOILETS are not cleaned, and sometimes doesn’t have toilet papers. One good thing is they provide with breakfast and dinner. But it is awful! They provide with cheap quality food which is why i always ended up buying my own breakfast and dinner from outside.  The heaters doesn’t work most of the times when needed.

The room itself is very small and cramped and during my time there one of the people I roomed with stole from me. The cleaners who entered the room left the door open on multiple occasions, enabling anybody to walk into the room - when I reported that I wanted the cleaners to actually shut my door once they'd left the room, the French receptionist asked me if I wanted them fired and made me feel terrible for even mentioning it. I was one of the only English people in the hostel and there seemed to be a genuine annoyance on the face of the receptionist (who I would love to name and shame) every time she heard my accent which was puzzling and extremely rude.

We were awoken numerous times in the night, without proper reason due to a mishap which easily could have been resolved with some common courtesy on arrival. Apparently - it is OK for people to check in outside of the their check-in time, and barrel in during the early hours despite no prior warning from hotel staff.  Incredibly rude manager, consistently blaming us for their own problems which could have been AVOIDED with some forethought from staff to inform us of arriving guests (if any, which would have been SO simple).  Not explained on arrival, not resolved quickly or with care of our poor experience, shocking and disgusting.

It is however good for covent garden and anything along The Strand. The service is just about polite but other than that I would say the best thing is the sign that says thank you for staying as you know you are leaving.  The room is tiny which to an extent was to be expected. However, charging someone £65 to stay in a room that doesn't look too dissimilar to some prisons is ironically daylight robbery itself.   The sink didn't have a plug and the curtain didn't even fully cover the window. The showers even though they were shared were in desperate need of a clean, even just to get rid of the mould would have been nice. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillow non existent.

The hop on hop off bus stop was a block away. Plenty of restaurants in the area. Depending on which staff was working, the morning breakfast was ok with toast, cereal, coffee, and tea.  I want to like this place but cannot in good conscience.  Down side, when I arrived (3 bed shared room), the room was a disaster; trash, food containers, clothes, toiletries thrown everywhere. I wouldn't bash a place for the conduct of a resident; however, after talking to staff and asking for another room (which wasn't available), I became aware that this was a long-term resident and the staff were fully aware of the state of that room and chose to rent it to me anyway. They even told me the cleaning staff refused to go into the room anymore because it was so gross. Having made my reservation a month in advance, they had ample time, knowing I was coming, to make other arrangements or deal with the situation. A staff member did go into the room and pack up all the trash and belongings so when I got back that evening the room was decluttered but still dirty; the sink was black. The cleaning staff did a good job cleaning the room the following day; that was much appreciated. Problem was rectified but should have been dealt with prior to my arrival and I shouldn't have had to sleep in filth for the 1st night.  2nd significant issue is the plumbing; some definite issues there.

I stayed here for new years eve in a private single room and was straight into the heart of the City.  The room was clean and the bed ok. Plenty of storage and no noise from the window. The bathrooms were poor quality. I avoided using it and thankfully decided to shower at the gym across the road which was doing a 3 day trial membership. The whole corridor smelled of stale toilet as it was not ventilated properly so the smell lingered and was extremely strong.  Please note the walls are quite thin.

1372,150,Bedbugs and filth!,"I stayed at this hotel many times years ago and was unaware that it had changed hands. What used to be a charming little property has turned into nothing short of a nightmare.  First, there is ample evidence that there are bedbugs (at least in room 27!). Blood spots on the sheets are the number one tipoff to that! But it was confirmed when I awoke in the early morning to one engorged with blood (presumably mine) crawling across the sheets!   The hotel is extremely dirty. There are stains and caked dust everywhere, most surfaces are sticky, and there were what appeared to be human hairs (both pubic and head) on the duvet and in the shower.  The staff is completely indifferent to the care or concerns of guests. Although daily housekeeping service should be a given, I specifically requested that my room be serviced while I was out for the day. I returned after 11 PM to discover that it had not been touched. I was too tired to care but I needed more toilet paper so I called the front desk. They told me I needed to come down and get it myself! So I got dressed again and left the room only to find a dodgy looking man standing 2 rooms away holding a roll of toilet paper. I took it from him and started to complain about the hotel and he said “Oh, I don’t work here.” Um, excuse me? He stood there and just stared at me while I keyed back into my room. The next morning I told the woman at the front desk. She asked me to describe the man and she confirmed that no one matching that description works there! So there is clearly a safety/ security issue as well.  The Wi-Fi does not work. And their website indicates that they offer several other services that simply do not exist.  The shower offered 2 options: scalding hot or freezing cold water. Warm water was not an option.   Due to circumstances beyond my control I had no choice but to endure 2 nights in this cesspool. If I had had any inkling that it would be this unsanitary and unsafe, I would have chosen another hotel. Even a homeless shelter would have been more comfortable and sanitary.

After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, I contacted the Hotel and placed my concern about the Hotel, the gentleman that spoke to me apologised and said that the hotel was now under new management and that they were about to go under a period of refurbishment to raise there profile.  I have recently read the current reviews on the Hotel and I have spent last 3 days phoning the hotel speaking to reception staff requesting to speak to the manager. I have been told to phone at 3 certain times to speak to the manager, which I have, the latest at 9030hrs this morning and again I was told, that he was not at the hotel.

1377,150,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,"Dear Sir/ Madam  Terrible stay. I have stayed in many hotels all around the world, and can emphatically say that I have never stayed anywhere so disgraceful.  The list of problems wew: My room was on the 3rd floor., The lift only goes to the 2nd floor meaning that you have to carry bags up a very narrow and steep flight of stairs, which is unsafe. The lift only works if someone on the ground floor holds the door shut, meaning that I was unable to call it when leaving, and had to carry my bags down 3 flights on steep and narrow stairs. Not safe!  No wifi in my room, meaning I could not work when I needed to.  The aircon is so loud that there is no reasonable way that you can have it on during the day, let alone during the night.  No hot water in the shower because mixer tap is damaged meaning I had to have a freezing shower this morning. The broken tap also makes a terrible noise.  No mini-bar, which the room is advertised as having.  No bathrobes which the room is advertised as having.  Most of the TV channels in room not working.  When I came down to breakfast at 7.30 I was told that it did not start until 8. How can people staying on business possibly wait until then?  When I did wait and came down at 8 I was told that the woman serving had not been given any money that day to buy anything from the bakers. There was therefore on dry slices of white bread and ham. This is not breakfast.  There was no-one to discuss this with and I was simply told to email. When trying to discuss this with the only member of staff on duty I met 2 other guests who were equally unhappy.  As well as terrible service, this hotel is in contravention of trading standards and environmental health, and I will be informing both of them.…",1.0,Date of stay: May 2022,The Colonnade Hotel,1977,3.5,698,463,203,162,451,0.866390041493776,May,2022
1378,150,DO NOT STAY HERE,"The website says it : Is an unforgettable experience"" and that is very true (the only thing that is). This is frankly the worst hotel I have every stayed in in the UK (or Europe for that matter).  It is dirty and in an appalling state of disrepair, no hot water or showers working properly (my workmate was on a separate floor and confirmed this), filthy carpets, lift not working properly etc etc etc. The entrance is a facade for check in, once you head past that then it is awful. To confirm my opinion, whist I waited in reception to leave 5 different sets of visitors (Australian, Mexican, French and 2 English) had the same complaint and opinion that the hotel was unfit to operate and should be closed (4* is laughable). The breakfast was embarrassing and frankly unacceptable. The only redeeming feature was the staff who tried to put on a brave face and to be as pleasant as possible. Sadly, I think they took the brunt of some very angry clients.  The hotel website says that ""93%  of our customers recommend us"" and yet there is no facility to make any comments, reviews or anything.

1379,150,LET THIS REVIEW BE A WARNING!,"I will begin by noting the positives: the hotel is in a pleasant, quiet neighborhood, convenient for travel into central London and the staff was friendly and willing to help as far as they could which was not at all far as all resources were lacking. I had made a non refundable reservation in advance to get a discount - a big mistake.  Initially our room was not as requested and we were put in a poky little room on the fourth floor where the following problems existed: Ceiling showed extensive water damage and furniture was badly worn and disreputable. The Card type room key was non functional so that a steel key tied on to the card was needed. The shower produced only a dribble and was poor in controlling temperature variation. The safe did not operate. No Internet even with a router directly outside our door. No stopper for the wash basin in the bathroom. Only two small slivers of soap provided and no more could be had on our request even though soap is generally regarded as a basic hotel need. Toilet flush needs pumping to make it work. Only one working electrical outlet - so choose between TV and charging the phone. Ironing board collapses and trouser press does not heat up. The lift only goes to the second floor so we had to lug our heavy bags up two floors on narrow spiral stairs (repeat each time but minus the bags).  The lift is described in in the hotel guide as the oldest working lift in London.  ""Oldest"" may well be true (how long since you had to operate lattice gates on the doors?) but ""working"" overdoes it: it works as far as it does only sometimes. When we made our complaint we were moved right away to another, more commodious room on the third floor (only needed to climb up one floor of spiral stairs when the lift agreed to work).  This room showed improvement in that the wash basin had a stopper but the shower still refused more than a miserable flow. The air conditioner worked even though it looked as if it had been attacked with a baseball bat but the remote control was inoperable so the only control on room temperature was by switching the unit on or off at the outlet. No maid service for the room existed and for the entire six days we stayed there, a heap of dirty laundry stayed on the floor in the corridor outside the third floor room. Again, the furniture was old, disreputable and scratched  and the trouser press/ ironing board fell out of its cabinet.  The safe was inoperable. Breakfast was made available (it is impossible to say ""served"" in an area that seemed to have been a night club at a distant time).  No coffee except Nescafe, juice might run out for late risers.  The harassed, tired lady working there needed more support and supplies than she was given. Overall there was an air of neglect which pervaded the entire premises.  Upkeep and maintenance had obviously gone away a long time ago.  A great pity since this could be a pleasant boutique hotel making the most of its location near Little Venice on a quiet street.  The management seems intent on letting it run into the ground and perhaps to sell the site although it is understood to be graded.  If an investor could arise and gut the interior and renovate it, it mightt regain its promise.  In all, a major disappointment.…",1.0,Date of stay: May 2022,The Colonnade Hotel,1977,3.5,698,463,203,162,451,0.866390041493776,May,2022

It looks reasonably good on the surface, but you don’t have to be there long to see that it has not been looked after and the staff and management are doing a poor job of running the place.  Main problems for us were that the lift was broken, the key cards don’t work so you need to be let in by a member of staff each time you return, no staff were present at reception after 11pm to enable reentry to the room (after a long wait they had to be roused from hanging out in upper floor bedrooms together), and our breakfast was forgotten on one of the mornings we were there (there’s no buffet due to covid, so breakfasts were meant to be brought to the room but ours was not).

The hotel is located in a residential area within a short walk (5-10mins) to the underground.The reception was just a chunky desk where the friendly receptionist sat. After taking copies of my keyworker letter and photo ID, they gave me a free upgrade to a 4-poster bedroom for being a keyworker. To the left of the reception desk was a homely lounge with plenty of seating, tables and the busy décor looked Victorian. There was even an armoured statue that looked regal. The room was on the 2nd floor and as I couldn't see a lift I walked up the old staircase and across the wiring and dust sheets as I think there was some work being done.

The first encounter was when we got into an old dated lift that refused to start, then in the bedroom, the tea and coffee and biscuits that should have been there were empty.

1477,160,Avoid this hotel!,"I’ll start by saying that we have stayed at several ‘budget’ hotels in London before, so we know not to expect anything fancy. However, The Sheriff Hotel is awful. Both the hand sanitisers in the reception area were empty. Our room was in a different building around the corner, the hallway and staircase were dusty to say the least. Our room measured approximately 8’ x 8’. The bed was pushed right up against the window, making it difficult to get in & out of, also that meant that there was nowhere to put water, glasses, watch etc. The ‘hospitality tray’ was dirty & held two tiny polystyrene tumblers, two teabags, two tiny pots of milk, four coffee sachets & four sugars. The soap dispenser by the wash basin was empty. The clothes rail hung directly over the kettle, definitely unsafe in my opinion. The floor was dirty-our socks & feet showed that within minutes of arriving. Everything was covered in thick dust, coat hangers, skirting, everything. We pointed all this out & were promised a ‘deep clean’. It didn’t happen. The ‘safe storage’ for luggage was merely a basement room, easily accessed by anyone & everyone, no security whatsoever. On the plus side, the bed was clean. I really don’t know when the website description was written-or the photos taken-but they certainly weren’t accurate. When we checked out the hand sanitisers in reception we’re still empty. I really can’t believe that ‘hotels’ like this are allowed to stay open in this day & age. Oh & they ‘no longer serve breakfast’ which, on reflection, is probably just as well.…",1.0,Date of stay: October 2021,Sheriff Hotel,471,3.0,67,165,104,57,78,0.6,October,2021

We should have known better with you get what you pay for but you don't expect hotels to have mould in them.  We were in room 32, it was small but fine for a couple of nights. The room smelt of damp as soon as we walked in and the bathroom smelt even worse.  The windows didn't lock, the bedding seemed clean but the spare blanket was covered in stains. The pillows were paper thin and with only 1 on each bed I asked at reception 2 days running for extra pillows but they never appeared. Had to use my coat as a 2nd pillow. Not acceptable. Also not acceptable was the mould in the room in several places. It a health hazard and we are reporting to the council.   The wallpaper was all ripped too but that doesn't partially matter and the doors slam and guests are considerate so we were laid awake for an hour at 6am while a family kept going in and out while leaving.

1479,160,DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!,"I know that you sometimes see terrible reviews mixed in with good reviews about hotels, but please, do not stay at this hotel. It was so horrific, we actually couldn’t stay in the hotel on the second night as the room was inhabitable and the hotel said there was nothing they could do so we had to pack all our things up at 11.30pm and take the 40 minute walk/ tube journey back to the car and drive the long journey home which took hours. On arrival, the beds were not laid out as two single beds, which is what we requested so we had to rearrange all the furniture before we could even put our stuff down. The room is the tiniest hotel room I have ever seen and there was barely any floor space so manoeuvring around the room was an art in itself. There was no wardrobe. Just a little rail mounted above the kettle and the hair dryer so basically a fire hazard waiting to happen as the clothes were dangling down on to them.  They hadn’t left us enough bedding as they had made up to room as a double so we only had the one duvet and one bed sheet. The duvet provided was absolutely disgusting and covered in large stains and marks, (I’ll attach pictures). The sheet was also covered in what looked like pubic hairs. When I got into the bed closest to the window, it felt very damp and cold however by this point, it was after 10pm so there was nobody manning the desk so we couldn’t get any new bedding/ speak about the damp bed so I had to sleep in this. The other bed was also  damp.  The next day, we headed out and there was torrential rain all day. When we came back in the evening, the roof was leaking heavily and dripping onto the bed (which explains why the bed was damp the previous night). The room had leaked so badly that the entire floor of the room was covered in puddles of water. The shower had also leaked so the bathroom floor was soaking too. The bed was absolutely sodden by this point and could not be slept in. I am 7 months pregnant so went down to the desk and explained that I could not sleep in this room. The guy seemed very uninterested and then said, we have no other rooms and shrugged his shoulders. I told him again that it was not possible to stay in this room. He said he could give me some bedding but can’t come and change it because of covid. He failed to see the point that the bed was sopping wet and there was a leak dripping on to it so would be dripping on me all night!! I said I want a refund and he said I could if I checked out now. Where could we go at this time of night?!  My younger brother, who was staying in the room with me, told the guy to come and see the room for himself as I was struggling to walk up the 3 flights of stairs again and I was also feeling quite distressed at this point. The guy couldn’t seem to see the issue with the room, even after my brother had to point out the quite obvious issues!! Again, he said there was nothing he could do but give us some bedding. Therefore we had no choice but to go and pack up our stuff and leave. On top of this, on the way home all the fuel stations were out of fuel and we ended up running out of fuel and got stuck until 5am until a family member had driven round and managed to find some fuel and bring it to us (45 minutes away from home!!!) - obviously this is not the hotels fault but would have been avoided if we could have stayed in the room we had paid for!!! They have taken the money from my card and judging by other reviews on here, I don’t think I’ll be getting my money back.…",1.0,Date of stay: October 2021,Sheriff Hotel,471,3.0,67,165,104,57,78,0.6,October,2021

Went to bed - no bites, woke up - literally 40 bites on my arms, hands, and legs. I didn’t realize at first (thought it was a pesky mosquito) but after I checked out of the hotel I went to the doctor for something else and she noted that the bites were from bed bugs. I remember seeing dark stains on the sheets and blanket and wondering what they were. We called the hotel to let them know, and the guy just said “oh I’m so sorry!” Would’ve been a bit more reassuring if he’d promised to clean the room for the next guests.   Beyond that, the staff was not very friendly (we arrived to check in and the people behind the counter told us to wait for someone else as they ate their lunch in front of us) and the…",1.0,Date of stay: September 2019,Sheriff Hotel,471,3.0,67,165,104,57,78,0.6,September,2019

Claimed they were only receiving £77 from the site (I paid HotelsTonight much more than that) and the room they had available was a family room which they could sell for £300+.

Putting a double bed in a single room is just bad practice. I think the General Manager and staff need to be trained in hospitality. Dirty and Unkempt Balcony, poor breakfast selection. How they got a 5 on there Hygiene food rating beats me. Vast Improvement needed. Take the Criticism we are only trying to help.

The initial walk in if the bedroom was quite pleasant until I looked out of the window to see dumped old mattresses lots of pidgions and quite frankly a dirty and filthy back yard. I changed rooms to the annex which was similar style. Very small with a made up double bed of two singles on wheels which readily moved away from the wall proberbly due to the imitation hard wood floor. The bed and pillows were very  uncomfortable.

Our room was ridiculously tiny!!! Stay away from Room 38 at all cost. You could barely open the room door before you hit the bed. And the bed itself took up about 90% of the room leaving next to no space to get passed it onto the balcony or the other side of the bed. Had to shimmy across the bottom of it which is a fire hazard in case of emergency. It was easier to just climb across the bed to be honest which is not ideal. The bathroom was cramped and it was hard to even take a shower! Barely any space to put your suit case or belongings.

I was checked in by two people who didn’t actually speak to me other than to ask my name, I can only describe it as an odd experience.  Once you leave from the main lobby, the remainder of the hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment.   My room was shabby, dated, missing chunks of the wall, large marks and chips in the doors. The bathroom was clean but in total disrepair with a line scale laden shower head and black moulding in the corners.

We had afternoon tea booked and went to the bar to let them know we were there, but sat at table for half an hour until my husband went and prompted them again. Fortunately for us the manager Abdel came on shift and proceeded to see to us and sorted our afternoon tea out very quickly and gave us a complimentary glass of champagne.

Firstly, drink vouchers were given, not the usual access to an all day access club lounge with access to soft drinks, wine and beer. More disappointingly there was absolutely no flight snacks served.

It took hours to be moved, because the front desk insisted that they send maintenance up to troubleshoot it, which took hours; maintenance said it was broken and offered to send up a fan (an hour+ later and it was blastingly noisy).

The person checking us in wasn't very friendly, but at the end said, ""This is your room number; I've upgraded you"". We were in the city to celebrate our 15-year wedding anniversary -I had mentioned this when booking and requested a quiet room- so we were delighted when she said this and made our way to the seventh floor, excited to see our upgraded nice room. When we got to the end of two long hallways to our room and opened the door, we were first speechless and then both started laughing. I thought the window curtain was a curtain dividing the room and what we initially saw was the antechamber! We could barely both fit in the room; it was about 100 square feet.

Rooms are spacious by London standards and I like the fact that you get a bathtub (all rooms I think). Location is ideal and it is literally less than a minute from Gloucester Road Stn. Most amenities are steps away (like cafes, supermarkets, pharmacies, etc) and you can have a pleasant 20 minute stroll up Gloucester Road to Hyde Park and Kensington High Street or along Cromwell Road to the Natural History Museum.

It looks like it took maintenance a few goes to fit the towel rack leaving lots of holes on the bathroom wall, the hairdryer plug was loose on the back but I easily managed to screw it back on..some people may not think about the risk of using a faulty plug.

The room had no extra pillows, sheets and was not properly cleaned or restocked. Most days not before 16:00. We had to call twice for new towels and shampoo.

On our first returning visit last month we were delighted to see that many of the staff we have come to know well were still working at the hotel.  The Reception was efficient and we had excellent and prompt service from Abdell and Anna in the Bar. Abdell remembered us from previous visits and looked after us very well. The Club Room was fine although we were disappointed to find that the Club Lounge was not in use.  we hope that becomes operational next time we stay.

The room was fine however at 3am the fire alarm went off briefly and then stopped I called the concierge no reply it then went off again my husband went to reception and was met with bedalam . The next morning I asked at reception what had happened and expecting an apology was met by quite a rude person who tried to tell me there was a real emergency when clearly it had been a mistake.

1670,180,Underwhelming. Bad experience,"The YMCA Indian students hostel is a very disappointing place. I stayed there a week this month and this was my experience: 1. The single and shared rooms in the basement are highly avoidable. Badly ventilated and noisy, they do not have lift access and you get there through dingy passages and many steps, so too bad if you have luggage.  2. My room had a noisy heating mechanism, which sounded like loud water droplets the first two nights and then nothing short of a train track on the third. This can be a problem with old buildings, but my written and oral complaints to more than 5 people at the reception and maintenance went unheard. I was sleepless for most of the week, and the response of the staff was between tepid to simply ignoring my polite repeated requests for repair. A room change was not possible since the hostel was fully booked. 3. Knowing their location and their price, the Indian YMCA student hostel knows that they can get by with taking their guests for a ride. This they do by charging the full tariff amount at checkin (not checkout like most hotels/hostels) and then you are simply trapped into staying there.  4. The food timings are restricted, the chefs mostly loud and rude in telling you to finish up eating, and the dishes are poor. The rate card for guests at meals is simply not worth it. Coming from India, I can say that the Indian food here is really below average.  5. IF you stay a week, your room is not even cleaned once. Only if you stay more than a week do you get cleaning - why these strange rules? Overall, avoid staying here despite the great price and location. It is uncomfortable and not worth ruining the rest of your time in London.…",1.0,Date of stay: December 2019,YMCA Indian Student Hostel,124,3.5,28,50,25,5,16,0.28921568627450983,December,2019

1672,180,The best accommodation a budget traveller can find,"I was told about this hostel by my brother who lives in Yeovil. I booked their double bed attached room for 2 nights, the first 2 nights in London after which we moved to Feltham. The location is excellent in Fitzrovia and the Warren Street underground station is at a walking distance. My room was, I won’t say very small, rather just sufficient for 2 adults, but who cares, for the price paid its way too much. My room cost me £92 per night with dinner and breakfast included. Front desk was quite helpful too. They have a cloak room for which they charge £1 per bag per day.

1677,180,Indian ambience in alien shores,"We landed in London after a fairly long flight quite exhausted. This time the unusually hot English summer made us all the more hot & stuffy. At the YMCA reception the staff allotted us our pre booked room promptly. Since we could not allot a deluxe bedroom my expectation of the bedroom to be allotted was not much. But we were quite satisfied with the amenities provided by the standard double bedroom. The linen was clean & so was the washroom. The dining room with its friendly staff provided us sumptuous indian lunch for £9. Since breakfast & dinner was included within the room rent thus we had to pay for lunch. All the time we stayed there we had a pleasantly good spread of variety of indian food. The menu changed every day. The students who comprised the long stay residents created a very cheerful atmosphere about the place. There is a beautiful park surrounded by benches in front of the YMCA & this is why its known as Fitzroy Square. It is a very relaxing place where you can watch the world go by. The greatest advantage of this property is its proximity to the metro station and bus stops. You can reach any part of London by walking a couple of minutes to the tube station. Anyway we were very happy with our stay there & if we visit again, we will surely stay at the YMCA at Fitzroy Square.…",4.0,Date of stay: July 2018,YMCA Indian Student Hostel,124,3.5,28,50,25,5,16,0.28921568627450983,July,2018
1678,180,YMCA Indian Students Hostel – A good and safe option to stay when you are travelling solo,"A feel of India when you are not in India. Safe option in a central location. The best part people speak your language, they are from your part of the world.   Yes YMCA Indian Students Hostel is all this and much more. Don’t get tensed by reading the word student’s hostel-anyone can stay here. Few things to understand – it’s a hostel, so don’t expect hotel like services of bell boy etc. It’s definitely a much better option than many other hostels and many bed & breakfast options close by.   Location wise it is really good – walking distance from Warren Street & Great Portland Street Underground stations, even Euston Street stations (Underground, Railway & Bus) are close by. So connectivity is not a problem.   Some major London attractions are close by: Oxford Street (1.1 miles), Madame Tussauds (1.6 miles), London Eye (2.7 miles) British Museum (0.7 miles), Big Ben (2.1 miles) & many more. There are some good eating joints close by, you can also eat at the YMCA Dining Hall.   I was staying in a single room with attached bathroom in Jubilee Block and had breakfast in my plan. There are many other options available including options of room plus breakfast plus dinner.   The room I had was comfortable and had a cosy feeling to it. It had a decent wardrobe, a writing desk and chair, storage areas and a single seater sofa like seat. The room had facilities of :a) electric kettle and complimentary tea/coffee making kits, (b) LCD Television which aired BBC channels – some of the programmes were really good, the news channel updates helped me planning my day as it informed about the traffic/transport conditions for that day (c) Intercom facility.   The washroom/bathroom was decent and clean with shower cubicle. Basic toiletries – shampoo & soap along with towel were provided. The bed was comfortable with adequate bedding (pillow, comforter etc.).The floor was carpeted.  The housekeeping team didn’t give any opportunities for complaints. The team at the reception also is pretty helpful and does give you many cost saving suggestions in London.  Entry to the residential block is restricted to residents – I in a way liked it, while travelling solo sometimes in many hotels I have had some pretty uncomfortable incidences but this was not the case here.    Some people may find them pretty strict rule enforcers but please remember this is not a hotel. They allow you your privacy.  For me location wise this was a good place – easy to reach from Heathrow, easy to go down to my work place, easy to go down to my favourite destination – British Museum, easy to go down to Oxford street the shopping hub.   Coming to food - Indian food in a land which is not yours ..... YMCA tries to give you that. The breakfast which was given (as I was staying here) is decent - you will have options to have bread (normal white and brown) toasted or plain with jams & butter, tea and coffee, cereal (they serve different options daily) options like Appam / Poha/Chola Bhatura/ Omellette etc. Quiet filling. I tried the fixed buffet option for Lunch on Sunday at 9 GBP, decent fare with vegetable dishes, and non-vegetarian dish.  For a moderate to heavy eater the price is just right, for a light eater the price might look a bit steep. Fixed Dinners is what I got on (2 days). You have an option of a dessert also - I was lucky one day I got payasam or kheer and other day it was a fruit.  The food has South Indian influence but it’s a good option if you are tired of eating other stuff.    Remember just one thing - Just like NRI's the food also becomes Nahin Raha Indian - mainly because of availability of the ingredients.   The dining hall has fixed timing and they are pretty strict about the same.   Overall a good option. If I have to stay somewhere in Central London again I would surely stay here.…",4.0,Date of stay: June 2018,YMCA Indian Student Hostel,124,3.5,28,50,25,5,16,0.28921568627450983,June,2018
1679,180,Just avoid unless you want to ruin your trip.,"Absolutely disgusting service. I am not sure how they even operate in a city like London. My friend was staying there and I went to visit her from another country. They didn't even allow me to change in her room.

It is located very close to tube stations and stores , so this suits travelers. If you have kids above 5, you need to pay additional 30 pounds for extra bedding.

An example of this is here: There is a common iron box (press) for the hostel dwellers to use. But this is chained to the bench. By doing so they are creating a very bad impression about India. It is sad. But true. Also, the ladies' bathroom do not have latches!!!! RIDICULOUS. They quote an incident from the past wherein a girl was locked in. But this is not right.

I stayed at The YMCA Indian Student Hostel from 22/10/2016 (my second day back in UK soil) to departure datetime at 6.30am on 27/10/2016.  I had an unforgettable experience as a passerby traveller in this Hostel. The management in the Hostel had been very accommodating to my needs and circumstances because my original careers plan was to look for jobs in London and had intended to settle here as a waiter and/or a private tutor in all school subjects, English or Chinese to learners of any age, gender, creed and religion. The Hostel tried their best to allocate me a room to stay for all those five nights.

1700,183,Most definitely the biggest mistake of my life,"Staff seemed nice enough. Breakfast and dinner included, so that was nice too. Rooms were dimly lit. Hostel itself was quite noisy. Location was fairly good, and I chose it to save some money. I should've just sucked it up and paid more and lived in a hotel. The washrooms were filthy to a point where I could not use them. As someone of Indian origin, I'm ashamed of the fact that this place has the word Indian in it. I know exactly why a lot of middle-aged Indian men here are saying this was a great choice (cost). Believe me, if you pick this place, you're making a big mistake. It really took away from my London experience. I dreaded coming back to this room.

1701,183,The worst place I've ever stayed,"This place fleeces you like no other, leaving you feeling cheated and helpless. The rooms have zero facilities and the small window time for breakfast and dinner is constricting. While the cost of the meals is factored in, one can barely use the facility. Besides, the breakfast is so limited, and rationed out. Doesn't leave you with a good feeling, especially when you've paid very competitive rates for the stay. The staff are too rigid, and give the feeling that they're doing you a favour by putting you up.

Do not expect the usual UK ""Indian Restaurant"" menu, which is mostly based upon Pakistani or Bangladeshi cuisine anyway.  This is good simple food as might be served up in a typical Indian home.  On our visit there were two rice dishes, a couple of vegetable dishes, a paratha and a papadum.  Followed by tinned fruit for afters.  A pickle was also available.  Nothing was too highly spiced - in fact to my robust taste buds it was very mildly spiced.

Primarily, its the location. Its a 5 minutes walk from the Warren Street Tube Station, making is centrally accessible from/to most of the much visited business/tourist locations in the city. Secondly, the room rent includes an Indian breakfast and dinner. While the quality and choice of the menu could see improvement ......what it ensures is that when you leave in the morning or retire for the night, its with a full stomach.

On arrival in the room, I found it to be tiny, squashed, and pretty squalid.  In the middle of the carpet someone had tried to iron something and had obviously left the iron face down on the carpet!  So the pile had been burnt away and the cheap synthetic carpet showed the flat shape of the iron!  I don't believe this ""accident"" happened recently.  I suspect the people who run this hotel just aren't bothered.

I first came to the student cafe in the 1970s and enjoyed it. I seem to remember the restaurant was in a different building to the concrete block you see today. I felt very nostalgic and was persistent about trying to see if the food lived up to others' enthusiastic reviews. I've been here three times this year, 2014 - 2015. The first was near the end of lunch and not much food was left. It wasn't appetising or hot.  A few weeks later I tried again earlier in the day and was again disappointed.

The breakfast & dinner is included in tariff. A word of caution here, the dinner is typical Indian fare (not the curry house /balti /takeaway variety) so might not be to everyone's liking. The breakfast is continental with an Indian snack item.

1734,186,Good stay,"stayed for 3 days with family.  95 pounds for double deluxe room and 80 - 85 pounds for standard double room. Since we were with 2 children, double deluxe was better choice. They will not allow children to stay without extra beds; for which they charge 20 pounds each. Therefore, the net rate for us was 135 pounda a day. Still okay, considering that breakfast and dinner are included.  Dinner was superb, tasting just like homely food only. They have biriyani on sunday, which we all liked very much. Option for outdoor eating as well. Mr.Rasheed was very helpful during meal times. Sizable crowd during meal times. Meat is halal. Room was basic, with TV and electric kettles provided.

The rooms were rather well furnished, being one of the rare hostels we stayed in that was furnished with a television. However, while common toilets were clean, they were unfortunately constantly choked during our stay which was quite a disgusting sight. The bed i slept in (my friend's bed was okay) was old and the springs were exposed which made it very difficult to have a proper night's sleep on.

However, lack of information about parking on hotel website and via email before arrival caused an irritating drive around for 20 minutes after a long journey searching for the hotel / car park (neither of which can be seen or directly reached from the road due to the pedestrianised High Street and no dedicated hotel parking actually exists!  One is left to find out the hard way that there is no other option than the underground Waitrose car park, where a lift to the hotel lobby is situated near the far corner.  Signage for the hotel from the road is non-existent and signage from the Waitrose car park directing people to reception is not adequate either - we stumbled upon it whilst looking for the way out to try and find the hotel.  On complaining about this at reception, a staff member said ""the hotel website hasn't been updated and people always ring her for directions when they are lost!""  Honestly!!!  Travelodge are not being truthful on their website about parking, I suspect because people will be put off booking when they know there's no dedicated parking. Not good enough - really annoying!!  Honesty, adequate directions and signage woefully lacking here!  There did seem to be plenty of spaces there though - even on Jubilee weekend - the saving grace!…",4.0,Date of stay: June 2022,Travelodge Egham,552,3.5,213,144,84,43,68,0.75,June,2022

All of which is very unhygienic.   -There was a dirty mattress with a dirty sheet obstructing our hallway to where the door to our room was. This is once again very unhygienic and simply disgusting.  -The room smelt as though something or someone had died in it, it was unbearable. After quick investigation it transpired that the smell was emitting from the 'bathroom'. This was THE most disgusting bathroom I have ever seen in the hotel to the extent that it was unusable due to the fact it was so unhygienic. It was so bad I could not step in it to even have a shower- which I'm sure you'll agree is not much to ask for when paying for a hotel room. To be specific the smell emitting from the drain of the shower was as described above. There was brown/yellow standing water in the base of the shower. I dread to think what that could of been however it was simply unacceptable and unhygienic.   -The reception staff were asleep in the reception and could not be roused when I tried to complain. For that reason I was unable to make any complaint. This was both unprofessional and unacceptable.  When trying to contact the hotel for any apology or refund due to the state of the room the response recieved was: ""you already stayed  and I cannot do anything else"".  Absolutely disgusting hotel with a disgraceful customer service. AVOID AT ALL COSTS…",1.0,Date of stay: May 2022,St. Mark Hotel,406,2.5,21,85,134,63,103,0.8763485477178423,May,2022

1875,200,Avoid,"We booked the hotel for a weekend break.  2 adults and 12 years old son. For the first time didn't read the reviews about the place that I am staying in.  The hotel welcomes you with a really stained stairs carpet.  Next to our room there were bags on the floor full of beddings ( clean and dirty).Nobody moved them for 3 days of our staying.  The room which we were offered was the best in the hotel as it has a  small balcony and has a double and single bed.  Straight when you open the door you can smell a strange odor and it's not the old building/ closed window smell. To our shock the bathroom shower cabin was dirty with remains of soap and some hairs. The beds were ' tidy ' but no mattress protector under the sheets.Not only the  mattresses were stained but the  bedsheets as well  and the extra pillows were not fresh and had some oily stains. The mattress on the double bed had sunk on one side and was really uncomfortable.  The small balcony with 2 chairs had a lot of cigarette butts not only on the floor but in the flower pots as well. The breakfast was in the basement in a small room .continental breakfast  they say...slices of cheese and ham ( which were placed on the plate by a girl in the small kitchen with her hands!!!!! Not using fork or any other item neither washing her hands before), boiled eggs, bananas  white toast bread, butter. Coffee was ready portioned small Nescafe tubes which you could make with hot water. Stained cups and paper plates.  The location is great but the hotel management should really look for a deep clean and fix a lot of issues.  As if the rooms are clean and tidy,with nice fresh curtains,the walls painted and bedding freshly washed ,bathrooms clean and sanitized it doesn't matter that the furniture are old or the rooms small. Now it seems like they never clean/ wash.  Having a business is not only to take money and pretend that you take care of your hotel. It is also important to invest and take care of it.  Result: Good location but take with you cleaning items,  mattress protector , towels and you should be fine 🙂…",1.0,Date of stay: October 2021,St. Mark Hotel,406,2.5,21,85,134,63,103,0.8763485477178423,October,2021

It was so poor I don’t get how they could justify opening it up to the public. There was warm ham and cheese, broken biscuits in a bowl and dry cereal with no milk, all in a very cramped room with dirty outdoor tables inside.

This was very concerning and this is why I would prefer them not to come in, especially for a short stay.

I was given a room on the 3rd floor which was 54 steps away from reception.  There was no lift and I wasn't offered any help with my bag.  The fire door was wedged open with a can of air freshener and there was a pile of dirty laundry just outside my door.

There was tea and coffee sachets placed in a very dirty breakfast bowl and 2 cups, one chipped and dirty.

To be fair, they had booked this initially for themselves and were under the impression it was a real steal, I am just glad they will never know how awful it actually was.  On the upside, the room was clean. And that was about it.   So basic it was reminiscent of a hostel, with a sink so small in the bathroom you were unable to wash your face in it as you couldn't quite squeeze your head in between the narrow washbasin and the tiny cupboard just above it.

Breakfast is served in an underground room with very few seating, if you arrive late, prepare to stand and eat your toast!  It was overall an average experience.

The first thing I noticed was that they over charged me by nearly double and when I questioned the charges the staff spent nearly 20 minutes looking through my booking and were then unwilling to help. They referred me back to expedia/hotels.com and refused to do anything else, and were very rude about it.  When I returned home and called hotels.com I was informed that, although the booking was made online, the hotel itself accepted the actual charge and I would have to contact the hotel.

Of course it's a budget hotel (we still paid over 100GBP per night) but the staff were also rude and dishonest.

The staff were extremely rude when we checked in and after realising there was a problem with our booking they weren't willing to take any responsibility. I simply wouldn't stay here again because of the rudeness of the staff and the untrustworthy way they dealt with the booking mishap trying to charge us more money.

Every single time I wanted access to my room, I had to queue at the reception desk (lo-o-ong queues!) to ask for a porter or the cleaners to open for me. This was insanely, outrageously annoying. Many times new keys were cut, which did not work. I’m writing this at 23.30 on my last evening, in the corridor, locked out of my room yet again. I’ve been to the front desk, for the umpteenth time. I was told to wait, for the umpteenth time. When I said I was tired and wanted to go to bed, the security guard started telling me, not very politely, that I should have a little patience. Really?

Not enough table space for the kettle and cups etc, no dressing table to do make up etc.  Beds: mattresses are too soft but thats personal choice.  Bathroom: Smallest sink I have ever seen in a hotel, good height though.  Struugled to get to show taps due to the positioning of the shower screen which can't be moved due to the sink position.

2071,220,Worth to return any time!,"Our 1st stay there. Despite of some small shortages – I would not reduce 20% of points in the 5-stage scale thus happy to give 5. Ready to stay there again.  Location: a good location with a view and ca 10min walk to Westminster. Vauxhall Underground station is ca 5min walk (NB! Google maps gives bus no.77 the most comfortable way to reach the hotel but Underground is more comfortable according to my opinion). Some small shops nearby and also The Rose Pub that I really recommend.   Personnel: professional and friendly. Obviously after C19 it takes a bit time to organize the working processes with the new stuff to the highest level. For example I asked an extra blanket and heater from the reception. The reception lady finally found a piece of paper to write it down but after 2 hours there was nothing so I called from the room. Then we got the heater but no blanket. Finally we got the blanket also. Also there was a kind of confusion with heating. We had 2 rooms and it worked in 1 room only. The FM-guy told the summer season started and it should not work there neither. In the lobby we were told that heating should work. Anyway – we got a heater and it helped.   Breakfast: on the 1st floor (and also on the 12th floor’s executive lounge with a great view. I do not know why we were offered one breakfast there but we are grateful for that). Good selection, very tasty. Specially I would like to mention about bacon – it was tasty and juicy, not overcooked like in many cases. Also fruits were very tasty (so juicy and sweet plums were a real surprise!). Also a coffee was very good!  Room: big (incl for morning exercises), clean, comfortable (incl for office work). Free&fast internet. Night-curtains (with remote closing-opening). A fridge for beverages.   Bathroom: big, clean, well equipped. A basin’s sidetable – there was even more free place after my wife unpacked her cosmetics. A bath. Shower enclosure with a thermostatic mixer and surprisingly strong water pressure. Just a toilet brush was missing.   Sleep: one of the most comfotable beds and pillows I have ever had in hotels. Specially I would like to say good about the pillow.  Spa: a swimming pool with some sunbeds, steam sauna, Finnish sauna. Lockers for your belongings. One evening Finnish sauna was ca 90C, then next evening for some reason just 50-60C (seemed to be turned off but actually it was just at ca 19.00). Towels and drinking water available.

It’s not a 4-star hotel.  Our family of two adults and two kids booked a family room with a kitchenet which comes with one large bed for the adults and one pullout sofa. I have never stayed at a hotel in which the pullout sofa was not made up before we arrived. Not a big deal I can make the bed myself but upon our late arrival of after 10:30pm we were asked to wait to see if our room which had a 15:00 check in time was even cleaned or ready.

Lamp shade wasn’t properly attached to the lamp, damaged table and tv remote that would only work when you hold it very close to the TV.

2172,230,Staff are thieves,Please do not book this hotel.  We asked to move rooms in the early hours due to a loud noise which turned out to be a huge air con unit at the back of the hotel. Staff were making out they didn't know what this what but clearly had complaints about this before.  We was eventually moved but due to being exhausted with no sleep i forgot my diamond earrings on the bedside table. When I asked the the following morning if they had been handed in they just said no and that the room is now occupied.  Very limited English from any of the people that work there but in hindsight I should have demanded to speak to a Manager but I was just so tired and did speak to several people to see if they had been found.  The earrings were very dear to me but they have basically been stolen,1.0,Date of stay: May 2022,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,8523,3.5,1983,3148,2043,788,562,0.6224066390041494,May,2022
2173,230,Worst Hotel in all my years of travel,"This hotel was an absolute dump.  Everything that can break down was broken, air conditioner not functioning properly and there was a stench of mold coming out of the unit, windows don't open, toilet didn't flush, sink didn't drain, TV didn't work, no phone,  had to be serviced twice, furniture run down and falling apart and needs to go to the trash, no light bulbs in the lamp and lighting so poor it was impossible to find anything in the suitcase.  Most days no water left in room. Wallpaper patched and dirty, rooms dirty, no drawer pulls on the dresser and drawers not clean. I asked for a lighter blanket and was told, after three days of asking;  the hotel does not have blankets, only duvets.  Staff at front desk is incompetent and rude.  Lobby is permeated with the stench of a cheap, nauseating perfume piped in.   What are we trying to cover here???  Furniture in lobby broken but not removed, roped off instead. This place is horrid, run down and dilapidated  and needs to be closed for renovations which are sorely overdue!!!!  I would also give this hotel a less than zero rating if there were such a thing.  Oh and by the way, the bar does not make cocktails!!!   The staff in the dining room and housekeeping do not speak English.  Breakfast was mediocre to say the least, and most days the toaster was not functioning.  Avoid this place at all costs.

2175,230,Avoid - dated and unclean,"Unfortunately this hotel promises so much yet delivers so little. The rooms are incredibly dated, shabby and basic. Decor is unclean, aged furniture and a dubiously ancient air conditioning unit. Room windows don't open, even just a little, to allow free flowing air, which given the ancient air con, would be appreciated.  No side table lamp, bathroom not especially clean, and no homely decor.

2176,230,Really bad,"Hard to write a positive review about this hotel, it’s simply very bad! Firstly, hotel and rooms are old and tired, poorly maintained, and in urgent need of renovation. You get a 90s (!) vibe. Secondly, staff are cold and indifferent, and literally couldn’t care less about customers. They actually display their bad mood, making sure customers notice how bad they feel. This is overly clear at the reception desk, where none of the staff is helpful, nor extends any apology for a mistake, let alone offer a solution to a problem.  Nobody picks up a phone, anywhere. No matter who, whether it’s reception, housekeeping, or even the operator. Phones might as well be removed from rooms.  Laundry is not returned the same day, despite the promise on the laundry form that laundry sent in by 8.00am will be returned the same day. Going down to the reception to inquire about the returning laundry, is simply replied with “housekeeping is already closed, try tomorrow.” Having to explain that that is not my problem, but the hotel’s problem, is simply met with a shrug of the shoulder by a receptionist. It’s simply incredibly bad. Housekeeping is poor, needs to be chased via reception (because they don’t pick up the phone) to replenish daily items like tissue paper. Restaurant staff couldn’t be more cold or indifferent. This hotel survives on airline crew business, but service to other customers leaves a lot to be desired. First and last time I booked here, there are many alternatives in Kensington.

Couldn’t solve a single problem between them. Ended up walking out after waiting for over two hours. Couldn’t give us a refund straight away either, and said we had to sort it out.

The conference Area's all nice. The rooms however are dated and not cleaned properly.  I paid for a club room. This used to include certain privileges but they have all been taken away yet the price remains the same.  Our fridge had the previous guests take away in.  Reception woke us up at 2.30 in morning with the wrong number.  No one apologised, the management don't care and seem to work on a crazy rule of get them in the door and it's job done.

2179,230,"Tired, tired, tired","I would describe this hotel as all fur coat and no knickers, outwardly it looks impressive, the lobby area, the landings and corridors, but on entering our Club Double on the 10th floor we were greeted by a room that was beyond tired it was exhausted!  I'm not big on four in a bed forensic examination, if it looks OK then it is, you just need to look at my room photos to see what is on offer. It cost just over 370 pounds for two nights, discounted to just over 340 through Booking.com, that included breakfast which was actually pretty good. On entering the room after a long journey I was ready for a brew, the cup had a crack right through it and through the handle, I buzzed reception and asked for a replacement, they said no problem...it never came. On our second night we were going to the theatre, my wife showered then sat down to dry her hair, the fitted hairdryer spit and stuttered then stopped, I rang every service apart from emergency on the room phone...no answer, so I went to reception, I explained the problem and asked for a plug in dryer, the receptionist said they didn't have one, I asked to speak to the manager and she came and said she would send an engineer, I said that is no good we are going out my wife needs to dry her hair now, but she said she would send an engineer...no one came and the hairdryer was still knackered when we checked out next day.  Now this may not seem such a big deal but I'm sure the ladies who read this will relate to the fact that my wife had a nice dress to go to the theatre, with damp hair she didn't get to dress up, instead she combed it back tied it up and dressed down. This time wasting meant we only just made the theatre, no time for pre drinks or anything.  I'm not sure if I expect too much for 370 quid for two nights, maybe I'm out of touch.  I don't think any number of complaints will cut any ice, this hotel is very busy with large parties checking in all the time so I'm sure they won't give a knack, but we will not be returning.…",2.0,Date of stay: June 2022,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,8523,3.5,1983,3148,2043,788,562,0.6224066390041494,June,2022

The screen came off its track and fell forward, towards me. Its roughly foot x 4foot of glass with a metal surrounding and heavy. I was quick enough to put my forearm up to take the impact and used my other hand to take the weight.

2270,240,GROTTY,"Where do I start? First, when we asked about breakfast told no breakfast due to Covid, this was one of the main reasons for booking this hotel.  Why is it other hotels are now serving breakfast but not this one? When my husband looked at their website it was still advertising breakfast, when he showed the guy on reception he said he would tell the management and get it removed. We used the lift as we had luggage, says for three people, can barely get two with small cases.   The hallways and stair carpets are disgusting, red patterned carpet, it was black around the edges, stained and looked as though bleach had been spilt in many places, not a good first impression. Room was very tired and uninviting.  Luckily I took anti bac wet wipes.  Not sure when the room had last been cleaned to Covid standard.  Tops of bedside cabinets were dirty, shelves were black and I do mean black.  I cleaned the whole room at this stage, every top and shelf was dirty, bearing in mind they could not swerve breakfast because of Covid yet rooms obviously not steralised to Covid regulations.   Only two double sockets in room, one was high on the wall for the television, the other by the mirror, no light over the mirror, not good for putting makeup on, curtains right next to mirror making it very dark.   No sockets either side of bed. No shaver socket in the bathroom, there was a plug supplied for use inn the bedroom.  No plug for sink, which means water has to be kept running for wet shavers like my husband.  Black toilet brush which was covered in toilet paper.  Stayed like this for the whole of our stay, which would suggest bathroom not cleaned properly while we were there. One night kept awake by the person in the room either above or below us snoring!!!!!  Added to that the pigeons decided they were going to make a nuisance of themselves as well.  Room was warm with no heating so could not close it to keep the noise out.   Scaffolding outside of room, no sign of any work going on.  Window frames needed painting. Court yard looked shabby and needed lots of TLC. There was plenty of hot water, sheets looked clean and bed was quite comfortable.  Two guys on reception were pleasant and helpful.  For breakfast we used the Tesco few hundred yards away. Close to bus stops and  underground. Hotel needs lots of TLC, front needs some work to make it look inviting.  There are lots in the area which look nice on the outside.

2277,240,You get what you pay for ,"I booked this hotel for a 1 night stay for our family as we had an event taking place in London and this was cheap! Firstly the main reason I booked this hotel was because it stated both on booking.com and on their website that they had parking. THEY DO NOT HAVE PARKING!! Secondly because it was close to where we needed to be plus it was cheap with breakfast included. However we were sorely disappointed. The ‘hotel’ if you can call it that was just terrible. I had booked a family room as we had children with us. We were given a room on the 4th floor! The lift was a nightmare seriously my husband got in and that was it literally no room for anything else including luggage! If you have claustrophobia you would probably go crazy hear and if you don’t have it you most definitely would after your stay! Not just the lift there whole hotel is basically a corridor width in every direction. The room was relatively ok however the floor had not been hoovered. The sink was broken and the bedside table tops were cracked. The beds however were quite comfortable so we at least got some sleep. The ‘breakfast’ of you can call it that consisted of bread, 2 types of cereal, cheese slices, milk, orange and apple juice. That is what they called a continental breakfast! Seriously we should have walked out of there and gone somewhere else however we thought it was just 1 night we could get through it. They only redeeming factor for the whole experience was that the staff where helpful.  Like I said above you seriously get what you pay for, after this experience I will never go for the cheapest again not worth it.

The hotel does however have a number of stairs leading to some rooms  so people with mobility problems or who have a lot of luggage could be challenged.

It had an en-suite which was fine except that it would have been nice to have a more powerful shower.  Breakfast is basic to say the least but was fine for a couple of nights stay.

On the plus side its a short walk from Earls Court tube station,another reason why we chose to stay here.

I feel terrible that I didn’t catch the name of the first person.  I can tell you he works overnights. He let me Borrow his iPhone charger to charge my phone and battery. We were missing the adapter so we couldn’t plug in our stuff. Thank you sir for being so kind and letting us borrow it. He also delivered a fan personally to our room because it was hot since there is no AC in the room. Another person I need to thank is Yasin. He was so helpful in getting us an appointment to get a Covid test the morning we were leaving to go back to the states. We were having a hard time getting a test done but he was able to get us an appointment early morning at Bloomsbury health centre. Thank you so much Yasin!  We really enjoyed our trip to london. This is actually my 4th time to London, I just love it there!  It was my friend’s first time and she had a great first time trip. I hope to stay with you all again!  If I had a couple of suggestions, it would be to have an AC in the room because it does get rather hot especially when the higher up you go on the floors. My second suggestion would be to invest in USB ports so we can just use a USB wire to charge phones. If I remember correctly we did have one in the room but it was not working.

Dear President Hotel - the basic needs of a hotel room is it for to feel clean - I really felt like I was sleeping a bed that thousands have been in before me - which is probably factual - but that’s not how you want to feel when you stay in a hotel - I could still smell the room an hour after I left - couldn’t wait to get out of there.

I had initially messaged the hotel to say I'm arriving a little earlier than their check-in hours (which was 2pm), and that it was me and my partner's anniversary so if they were able to do something for us - to which they replied they'd try do what they could to help celebrate and so they did, which was great! We got into the room and they'd placed a small bottle of wine with a card saying happy anniversary, and a towel swan with rose pedals on the bed, so that was cute...and honestly, this is why I'm giving them 2 stars only.   The room size was fine,…",2.0,Date of stay: May 2022,The President Hotel,4563,3.5,734,1772,1374,434,251,0.2995850622406639,May,2022

After a great day out in London, we were welcomed back to the hotel, and the staff were present if we should have needed them, we then had a drink in the bar, which is a large, spacious, beautiful Art Deco style.

2470,260,Friendly Opulence just a few steps from Buckingham Palace,"We were fortunate to receive invitations to a Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace, so booking a room the the evening before the event at the Rubens made perfect sense, as it is directly across the road from the Royal Mews and just a few minutes walk to the Palace's  main gates.  We booked with Booking.com and got a great rate for a superior room.  As we would be taking hat-boxes as well as suitcases, it made sense to drive to London and reserve a valet parking spot in the hotel's garage.   The hotel charges around £70 to park overnight - which sounds excessive, but is competitive with even NCP self-parking in the area, which will cost a similar rate. (Remember if driving that you'll also need to pay the Congestion Fee to TFL to drive into the City centre)  On arriving we parked outside and were greeted at curb-side by their doorman, Joey, who helped us with our luggage and took the car-keys off us so that he could park the car.  It made arrival with lots of luggage effortless.  We entered the hotel's impressive, wood panelled lobby with a lovely chandelier. It has the feeling of welcoming opulence. Regal, yet homely.  We were efficiently checked in and (as I had mentioned when booking that we were staying for a special occasion) upgraded to a palace view room.  A porter took us up to our room which was one which had been recently refurbished with a subtle sage green palate  with hessian wallcoverings and matching sofa.  The room was hung with a glittering chandelier,  supremely comfortable king size bed with top quality bed-linen, flat screen TV, bedside tables, lamps, thick drapes and a view straight to the Palace's Royal Mews opposite.  The room was equipped with aircon, iron, hairdryer and had incredibly effective noise-insulation, so that noise from the city outside was barely audible.  There was a good size bathroom with high-end complimentary toiletries, thick fluffy bathrobes and a good array of towels.  All towels, bathrobes, pillow cases and bed cover were richly embroidered with ""R"".  The following day we enjoyed afternoon cocktails in the bar, before attending the event at the Palace.  On returning to the hotel, Joey brought the car around.  Our  luggage was loaded into our car and we left to drive home.  An effortless stay with really attentive staff and every amenity you might wish for to hand.  Highly recommended.…",5.0,Date of stay: May 2022,The Rubens at the Palace,5535,4.5,3960,1129,285,121,41,0.03900414937759336,May,2022

Everybody we met, from concierge to waiters to housekeeping were so very accommodating and showed a real interest in making our stay as pleasant as at all possible. My husband is a wheelchair user, and during thirty years of travel, we have never come across as friendly and safe accommodations, in both the reception of us, the solving of small, practical problems and – not the least – the best yet explanations in case of an emergency, something that hotels rarely discuss. Breakfast was beyond excellent; facilities worked a treat and staff were eager to assist when needed. We dropped an item behind a small table, pulled it out to retrieve it, and yet did not see a speck of dust anywhere. We had scarcely been there for two days (in six) before we started talking about ‘when’ to return, rather than ’if’. When we were having the (mandatory) Afternoon Tea, enjoying the view to the Royal Stables, a family across from us had a brief wizard-fight on Harry Potter magic wands, and they did not bother anybody, so there was room for families too in an otherwise quite posh place! London is a splendid city to visit, as there’s something for everybody. And when doing so, the Rubens at the Palace is a perfectly situated and lovely oasis right in the centre of everything.

Him and Tony also made us laugh non stop and if you’re lucky they may sing you Hotel California while helping to hail a cab!  I had to do 4 stars only because we had a pretty bad tea experience, our server was uncommunicative about a misunderstanding, rude, rolled her eyes and made the tea experience overall uncomfortable.

From the moment we arrived we were welcomed by Rosie at reception who was immediately engaging & genuinely interested in our weekend plans. We were up to see the musical Matilda as my daughter is doing this with her theatre group back home. She was so touched that Rosie had printed off some Matilda bits & had written a lovely personalised message on the mirror saying she hoped she enjoyed the show. The following day was Easter Sunday & both Rosie & Zoe had prepared an Easter egg hunt for the children. The rooms were really peaceful & comfortable yet near to everything.

The whole feel was lovely, Ive stayed at the Ritz and Savoy and whilst they were more opulent I felt more like a hotel guest at the Rubens. It was more personal.

As soon as we arrived the doorman was friendly, helpful and accommodating, taking our bags as we went to explore before check in. When we were checking in the woman was so friendly and chatty (I think her name was Francesca), and would have given us any information we needed. We were concerned that we may feel unwelcome as two students in a five star hotel but they were all so welcoming, facilitated our request for a room with a bath and gave us a room upgrade. Inside there were treats to celebrate us finishing our exams! Great and thoughtful attention to detail. The style of the whole place was funky yet sophisticated, I would have liked to have spent longer there. The rooms were great, with lovely toiletries and tea and coffee facilities. And lots of mirrors. The pool area was nice, though if you're private you may want to walk down in your normal clothes as you have to pass through the gym! The robe didn't bother me. Gorgeous changing rooms there too. Unfortunately we only got to try breakfast at the Marylebone but this was exquisite and plentiful and in a beautiful setting.

2580,271,Convenient location. Closer to centre than you think,Stayed during a trip to RHS Chelsea. Really nice hotel. Quiet location and helpful staff. But expensive for what was. Told we had been upgraded on arrival which was nice. But not sure how as room could not really have been smaller ! The queen bed was 2 singles pushed together. Maybe the upgrade was pushing the beds together!  I hadn’t specifically booked breakfast. Asked if it was included and told that they were doing complimentary breakfasts. Was excellent actually. We probably didn’t spend enough time in the hotel to do it justice.  But was I thought really expensive at £400+ for just a room. Not stayed in London for 2 years.

The doormen, and people at the desk were excellent, as was Alba, the concierge.  A special shoutout to James, the very tall head doorman, who was friendly and kind.  The elevators come very quickly, which is a great perk for a small hotel, and the property is always very clean.  Our room, a double, was small, and not laid out as well as it could be.

Check in took a long time, the clerk seemed inexperienced and needed help to find my booking. I headed to the room and keycard didn’t work. I lugged my luggage back to reception and was given a new key. on returning to the room i managed to access, but it was a scene of devastation - an uncleaned room. Another return to reception and eventually secured a clean room. A very bad impression. I was offered a drinks token, but it was late, i was alone and heading for an early train.

2671,280,Overrated. Expensive.,"Expensive as you would perhaps expect for a Pullman, particularly given its location in London, but the quality of the room - bed, furniture, equipment and decoration - was little better than what you'd expect from an Ibis. The service was also confused. I arrived early and asked for room that would be quiet, as I had seen that other travelers had complained about rooms facing the road on low floors being noisy. The receptionist informed me that the only one currently available on the 8th floor was small. I said that I could wait, but in addition I also needed to extend my stay for an additional night and was surprised to find that the rate they gave me for that night was 50% higher than the rate for my 1st night! I took it, but instead of extending my reservation they actually made a new one, which later created confusion when I tried to charge things to my room midway through my stay as they thought that I had checked out due to the transition from the 1st reservation to the second. After waiting for the room, they finally gave me the 803, and that was when I realised that, beyond the bar/restaurant, the Pullman was just an expensive Ibis hotel! I try to check out the gym, but my key card didn't work, so I went down to the reception to get it corrected and mentioned that I was disappointed by the room, particularly given the price. The person at reception said that he couldn't upgrade me as the hotel was full, but that he could the following day, which they did, moving me to 801, which turned out to be a very similar room (i.e., same equipment) but larger as it was the one for people with wheelchairs (so not really an upgrade). The following day however, the confusion started as my key card didn't work again and I wasn't able to charge my restaurant bill to my room as I had been checked out and my new reservation had started! In summary, while the service was polite and friendly, it was confused and ill informed.…",2.0,Date of stay: June 2022,Pullman London St Pancras Hotel,5815,4.5,3574,1704,344,122,71,0.13360995850622406,June,2022

The hotel evening restaurant! I ordered chicken from the menu for diner, when the chicken came it was pink and looked very undercooked, I told the waiter (who turned out to be the restaurant manager) he said it was how the chicken was and it was ok but if I didn't want the meal I could choose another one. I am Coeliac so unfortunately all other options were not something I could either eat or liked. I asked the manager if the chief would do a simple omelette. Apparently the chief refused, when I explained to the restaurant manager there was no other option because of my allergy he just said that's fine he would take the chicken off the bill.

2677,280,"Nice hotel, with some basic issues","I stayed at the hotel recently, and had an overall good experience, but some things just didn't sit well, and so I write this feedback so that the hotel can try to understand, and maybe rise to the challenge of creating a hotel I'd like to revisit, rather then leaving me feeling a bit disappointed. Firstly, the room rate is REALLY high... over £400 per night - around double the average. Given the price, some things just didn't make sense. There seems to be a phasing out of 'residents bars' these days, and this is no exception, shutting as it does at 1am. Sometimes, when one has been out at a function or event, coming back after midnight and sitting having a quiet drink for a couple of hours was the norm, and resident's bars would stay open, manned by night staff, until you were ready to go to bed, sometimes till 3am or later. Not anymore. Doesn't the high room rate cover any night bar staff? Wow. Secondly, drinks prices.  I know London is more expensive than anywhere else, but £30 for four pints floored me. I was beginning to feel somewhat rinsed. Add to that the admittedly very nice room which, like so many others, was designed by and for men, with insufficient lighting or mirrors to apply makeup or do hair. I hope this helps the hotel see that although on the surface, it's a very nice place, it falls down on some pretty fundamental issues of hospitality.…",4.0,Date of stay: June 2022,Pullman London St Pancras Hotel,5815,4.5,3574,1704,344,122,71,0.13360995850622406,June,2022

When we expressed our frustration to the stocky Italian manager with glasses in the lobby we were met with arrogance and rudeness . He was the rudest person I have ever met.

2776,290,Where is the 5- star Service?,"I had great expectations for our stay in this hotel. I was a little surprised with all the great reviews. Our first qualm came when we arrived in our room. It was part of what seemed like a separate apartment. Smoke and alcohol prevented us from staying long. The hotel moved us immediately not many questions asked which we appreciated. But the hotel was quite worn down; some peeling paint, small cracks and loose sockets gave us a feeling that we overpaid for what should have been a 5-star experience. The neighborhood has changed since we were last there. This hotel is right at the cusp of two very different London areas.  Not sure I would stay here again.",3.0,Date of stay: March 2022,The Montcalm London Marble Arch,3488,5.0,3050,359,51,15,14,0.03319502074688797,March,2022

So grateful for such attentiveness.,"After a confusion about booking in the sister hotel, I was more than impressed by how Charles and his  staff rectified our disappointment. The trip for my daughter’s 21st birthday was transformed by the team at reception who really turned things around .. and more than making up for our initial disappointment.   The rooms were great  and bright and clean and modern . Lovely bath with clever design bringing light into bathroom.  The location is possibly the most central option for the west end .. everywhere walking distance … the stunning Marylebone high street , Selfridges , Regent street to Piccadilly.. quick taxi to Knightsbridge and Victoria and other stations .   Breakfast was really nice in lovely setting.   I didn’t get to use pool But nice to know it is there .   This is a lovely size of hotel… where staff recognise you as you go in and out and everyone very well Trained and most personable … most importantly .. authentically friendly .

This hotel is supposed to be 5 star, it certainly is not of that standard now.  It’s still a reasonable nice hotel, well placed, just off Marble Arch, but that’s about as far as it goes. Our room was very tired, and had many things broken or not working. Breakfast was only just adequate. The hotel bar most uninviting. Service throughout the hotel was pleasant, but not very good.

2862,299,Fantastic place,We booked as a mini Xmas break to go to winter wonderland. It was a great location for winter wonderland and really close to Marble Arch tube station so easy access to everything! When we arrived we had to wait a couple of minutes for our room cards so they gave us a complimentary cocktail while we waited (lovely). When the receptionist handed us our room keys she told us she had upgraded us to the royal suite room which was fantastic! One of the nicest rooms in the hotel at no extra charge. We loved it that much that we stayed in the room for a second night at the same price!

2866,299,Fantastic,"Stayed here during the end of summer holidays on Bank Holiday weekend, we were a large family - everything was well explained and presented - rooms were brilliantly laid out and the entire hotel as a pinnacle had the convenience factor being the unique selling point and wow factor together with the lavish, grand decor. Unfortunately, the spa and gym was closed for maintenance during our stay but this was obviously due to unexpected circumstances...  The rooms were spacious and well equipped with lifts being functional and quick, check-in process was simple on both rounds. We were offered welcome drinks as a nice gesture which was lovely.

During that visit I commented how terrible breakfast was, problems with coffee  plus some other comments on general service and condensation in the rooms.   I was reassured on here by the comments from the hotel that improvements had been made .   I had a similar business in the area so booked again for 7 rooms .  Made contact with the hotel stating previous complaint.  The hotel did upgrade the rooms to better than before but that was the only difference.  Breakfast was exactly the same . Poor service , broken down coffee machine both mornings ( only one machine) .  No extensive selection on offer .  Just a buffet English breakfast and poor service.  During business meeting in the bar area , nobody behind bar or came to the table .

We arrived a little early, but the connecting rooms we ordered were ready, and check in was quick. The rooms were clean and tidy, with a good bathroom with bath (as requested) and a powerful shower. We had also asked for slippers and bathrobes which were organised for us. Breakfast was a bit of a scramble on a Friday - thought there were 5 of us to seat and we hit peak time. The food provided was fine for our needs - machine coffee was good, filtered coffee in a pot OK too for us. The hotel was quiet and calm, and well placed for all the central sights and shops - it's behind Fortnum and Masons. Staff were helpful and accommodating.

2875,300,Wonderful location but overpriced.,"Tired hotel in need of a makeover. Gloomy lobby but welcoming staff. Wonderful concierge staff. I had an executive room which had a very comfy bed and very clean linens. The housekeeping staff kept the room spotless. However, it was a very strange shape and there is no lift to the 15th floor. That was fine for me, it was explained when I checked in, but if you had mobility problems that would be an issue.  Noxious smells from the shower trap - not pleasant and not dealt with.   Furniture in the room was worn and in need of replacing as was the carpet in the room and in the public areas.  Dining room was an unpleasant experience. The breakfast buffet is exactly the same as I have received in a Premier Inn!  Exactly the same!  But the staff were unfriendly and overworked.  It was such an unpleasant experience, I canceled my dinner reservation and went to a restaurant around the corner.

2880,301,Could do better,The hotel is in a great location in the heart of St James. The room and bathroom is a bit small and I have a general beef about shower-baths but at least this had plenty of grab handles to help ingress and egress.  Breakfast was a shambles with people having to queue to get in yet there was no shortage of vacant tables; simply no staff to clear away and re-set.  The food itself was not good and the fruit looked like it was prepared by a right-handed person forced to use their left hand!

We stayed in a superior bedroom and it was a decent size, clean and a great view towards the city and south bank. Breakfast was a low point. We waited around 20 minutes to be seated. No cutlery. Fruit cut up in huge inedible chunks. Bacon swimming in fat. Most of it was very poor quality including the fruit juice. A hotel breakfast should be a nice treat. This was not.

The hotel is nestled on a quite street full of lovely boutique shops. The bed was nice a comfortable. Housekeeping was prompt and kept our room tidy. The staff was helpful and friendly  The negative: The room was almost damp and incessantly musky. The bathroom was fine and served it's purpose but no more. The shower fine, but for the caliber we expected for a hotel of this price we found ourselves disappointed.

We have stayed in hotels in the surrounding area and this hotel did not live up to the other hotels we stayed at. We got checked in early, so that was nice. I asked for chocolates in our room for my husbands birthday, they delivered these after we got to our room, which again was nice. The room was small, smaller than I expected, I upgraded, which cost me more money, and I thought I may have got a bigger room, but it’s the skyline you pay for, so no bigger room.

The room, apart from being small and hot (you have to have the Aircon on also at night), was a bit dirty. Dirty cups, cupboards, dated bathroom that turns out totally wet when you simply shower. No floor towel. It had a flickering light. Drove me crazy. All in all a below average experience for 300 GBP a night over prized.

What is on offer is most definitely less than in recent years, full English ( but no fried eggs?) cereal , pastries etc but a much smaller selection than previously offered. Waiting staff were appalling. We had two very young waiting staff covering our area in the restaurant, both worked at a snail’s pace and left dirty tables unattended for an eternity.

The room was very small, essentially it was the size of the bed with a small desk in the corner. You would hit a bed with a chair, when leaving the desk.

2901,303,Reliably comfortable and friendly with a great central location,"I've stayed at this hotel many times and the staff are what makes the difference. 5 star hotels in London with hefty price tags don't necessarily equal fabulous front of house experiences. At the Cavendish, the front desk and concierge teams are courteous, professional and helpful. The location is unbeatable and within short walking distance to so many iconic sites.

Love staying here as the location is second to none, they have great staff and the place is very clean if a bit old fashioned.   I arrived very early and they managed to find me a room straight away which was a great start. The room was on the 6th floor (605) and good size, very clean and great bed & pillows. Slept really soundly.   Excellent choice of breakfast, fruit, pastries and cooked buffet - and a free newspaper. Check-out was 12 noon which is another plus - hate rushing to meet a 10am deadline.

Efficient reception, very comfortable albeit smallish room, bar is friendly but uses uncomfortable seating - it used to be much better. Hotel very clean throughout.  Location is the key point: walking distance of everywhere in the west end and Mayfair.  Breakfast is the only weakness: chaotic with tables uncleared, food and beverage items running out, untidy food debris allowed to accumulate around scrambled egg station, poor service generally.

As the evening progressed I was disappointed that the toilets became very wet (2 faulty taps) and very very dirty. A disabled toilet was situated in the foyer, but security refused entry despite long queues for the ladies toilet.

Superb location, stylish and contemporary decor; this is my number 1 hotel choice in central London.

The breakfast is absolutely delicious, lots of variety. We stayed in a ""classic double"" room which I thought was quite basic and not worth £250 a night but then I'm guessing you're paying for the post code? I would definitely upgrade to the Superior room if you can. The room was small, not a lot of room and there was a funny smell in there. The shower was big and powerful but it definitely needs re-grouting. You get ""The White Company"" toiletries which was a nice touch.

If you move about in the bed, the mattress base made a banging noise which was very annoying 3.

Our room was on the 2nd floor and situated on the corner of the building which meant it had two windows, one in the bedroom area which faced Duke St and another in the lounge area facing Fortnum and Mason. Not much of a view in the day but lovely at night as on the level of Jermyn Street Christmas lights. We slept very well, no noise from street or restaurants at all. The buffet breakfast was very good and the quality of products used was excellent, dinner was also excellent, best ham hock terrine I’ve had in a long time  and the beef cheeks are to die for. All serving staff were very efficient and friendly whether is was breakfast, lunch or dinner could not fault them.

We had an amazing evening there and the food was excellent. We were served by a lady whose name was GERDA. (She deserves a pay rise).

2943,307,Poor hotel experience!,"Poor service, small dated rooms, we were allocated a disabled room, the wash basin was so low and shower for a chair, bathroom flooded each time, we were advised the hotel was full even though we booked this stay in March!  The restaurant and bar staff were rude and dismissive, lots of them around just not providing a service.  The bar closed really early and does not accommodate residents, in fact the female manager was again dismissive.  The concierge team on the other hand were so pleasant and helpful, they put the rest to shame!

2944,307,Disappointed as a returning guest,"Based upon our last two visits we wouldn’t return.   We are repeated guests of the Cavendish for the past 10 years but unfortunately the product now being offered has slipped, the rooms fixtures and furnishings are looking tired and worn. The bathrooms water pressure for the showers is disappointingly low and the drainage taking water away from the showers is poor. The tea and coffee not being replaced in the room.   We had a lower floor room (3rd floor) and this room didn’t have secondary glazing which meant it was quite noisy and you could hear the recycling trucks emptying all the glass to cars going by throughout the evening and early hours of the morning.

Ok a little dated in places, true, I don't care!  This isn't advertised as a contemporary state of the art hotel, so you know what you're getting. And the prices are honest as far as I'm concerned.

2948,307,Tired & dated. Not worth the money!,"Booked the travelodge Waterloo and managed 1 night there as it was too far out for us and so busy we couldn't get a taxi so we booked the Cavendish as a treat for myself and my son, well what a disappointment first off we were put in a room right next to the lift so all we could hear was the lift going up and down all night I made a phone call to reception and we were moved to an alternative room which was very tired and dated, for what we paid the rooms desperately need updating, the bathroom was dirty and stained and most pieces of furniture were chipped or stained.  The only good thing about the hotel is the location.  I wish we'd stayed at the Travelodge at least they charge the right price for what you get.

2949,307,Sadly the Cavendish is not the hotel it once was,"Booked 2 superior rooms for 3 nights with breakfast, having stayed many times before.  The rooms are dated now.  Requested rooms to be on a high floor.  At checkin all that was available was a room on the 14th floor and one on the 5th floor. I took the 5th floor and because the windows are not effective I could hear shouting and screaming from a pub down below which went on to the small hours of the morning.    I was also shocked at how poor the breakfast has become - staff in disarray, no plates, poor selection of fruit - 3 apples on a plate one morning, no yoghurts.  Hot plate food limited, tepid and greasy.  Bacon cheap and nasty and overcooked.  Spoons for scrambled eggs, mushrooms and beans had been mixed up with the consequences of the 3 items being mushed together - very…",2.0,Date of stay: November 2021,The Cavendish London,4962,4.5,3022,1459,358,91,34,0.22738589211618257,November,2021

2952,308,Convenient location,"Room facilities good, very comfy bed.  All room items worked and air conditioning and heating effective. Our only gripe was the abysmal breakfast service over the weekend.  A separate ‘overflow’ room was in use but the replenishment of food in this area was poor at best.  Not a scrap of hot food for over 20 minutes and then it came in dribs and drabs. Completely different experience on a weekday when not so busy.

2953,308,Great location but nothing special,"Booked a single night for a date night and afternoon at the theatre. Spot on location for our needs and hotel of sufficient quality and decor for the area, albeit nothing notable and very 'safe' design. Unable to have in room breakfast (with no explanation from reception), and despite being on the 12th floor, the tired double glazing did not stop the revellers at 4am waking us both up. Breakfast was buffet with limited covid measures. Had to ask for a la carte menu which carried a surcharge for items. Service was average and had to ask service team to refresh glasses/cups as all in use. Overall very average and definitely not worth the £300+ room rate being charged.",3.0,Date of stay: November 2021,The Cavendish London,4962,4.5,3022,1459,358,91,34,0.22738589211618257,November,2021
2954,308,Room for improvement,"I was a little disappointed with my stay here. I stayed here years ago and it was a lovely hotel but it’s now looking just a little tired. For what I paid for the room I can forgive it that. My first issue was the contents of the fridge in the room. I found a half eaten pizza ( teeth marks and all) in a plastic tub, normally I would not expect to find such a gift from the previous occupant but in these COVID times where everything has to be either masked or sterilised beyond recognition it was very much an unwelcome gift.

The bathroom was clean. There was ampel with towells and new ones were supplied every day. The tub was quite high, so I guess an elderly person would have some problems getting in and out of it - but it was no problem for us. Big TV-screen and a fridge so you can keep drinks cold.

A room on the top floor which we had to find on our own. Finally got some sleep but this ruined our weekend away feeling tired and lethargic all the next day. Breakfast brought to our room with no milk, salt or pepper. We had to lean over a the coffee table to eat it which wasn’t comfortable or a good way to digest food.

For example, the room might have been fitted out with a few more double sockets, and stuff to plug in your tech on *both* sides of the bed.

The bathroom and toilet are separate, which is a bit weird and the toilet is in fact a dim little room you wouldn't want to spend any more time than essential in.

The main concern was the incompetent bar staff who would pour away drinks when a half was ordered instead of a full pint when they knew a pint had already been ordered by another guest, or the total lack of table numbers that leads to a hilarious chase of the bar staff doing multiple circles around the ground floor asking each table who ordered x pizza or y pasta, but ignoring the people who actually ordered the food trying to wave them down - for reasons?

3070,320,A Gem of a Hotel in the Heart of Royal London,"Hotel 41 is a jewel of a hotel. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and very clean. The Executive Lounge is open to all guests 24 hours a day with food, drinks, and a friendly, well-trained staff on hand to assist. The location can't be beat -- it is literally across the street from Buckingham Palace. I can't wait to visit, again!",5.0,Date of stay: May 2022,Hotel 41,3749,5.0,3473,197,58,16,5,0.0016597510373443983,May,2022
3071,320,The perfect date night,"Where do I start? This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and somehow it was even better than the first!  Due to the pandemic, our previous two bookings had to be rearranged. We got engaged at Hotel 41 on the 18th December 2015 and have always wanted to return and last month we finally got there. What makes it special, beyond the beautiful decor, attention to detail, delicious food, etc, is the exceptional service. Somehow, the staff make every guest feel they are their most valued customer and they will go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible experience.  We were welcomed by Erica and shown to the lift. As soon as we entered the lounge, Lauren welcomed us, ensured we were comfortable and brought the champagne trolley over so we could enjoy our first bit of luxury as we checked in. We then decided to get some lunch and soak up the atmosphere as we reminisced about our previous visit and were brought breadsticks, olives and nuts to nibble.  Although we had originally planned to return in December, September showed us a totally different side to the hotel. Light floods through the skylight which makes the lounge (a relatively small space) bright and airy. My husband chose to have the wagyu burger while I opted for the lobster mac and cheese. Hotel 41 will make reservations on your behalf for other restaurants but we’re really glad we decided to stay at the hotel as the food was excellent and David, who served us, was charmingly attentive.  After lunch, Marlen showed us to our room. We were lucky enough to stay in 4128 - the Balmoral Suite. Wow, just wow, it was something else! We have never stayed anywhere as fancy as this room. There are two bathrooms, both with showers (one has a bath) and a separate double shower as well! There’s an office and dining area and two sofas in the lounge area. You also have luxuries like electronic blinds, a huge walk in closet and multiple TVs.  I’d arranged to have a bottle of champagne in our room and this was beautifully presented alongside a handwritten card, a cake and petit fours. It really is the little things that make Hotel 41, and we want to say a heartfelt thank you to (the other) Lauren for the kind words and sentiment in the card.  We then enjoyed a sunny afternoon on the rooftop (this didn’t exist in 2015) sipping cocktails and watching the hotel’s bees from a distance. The hives are tucked out the way but it’s worth going to have a look. Sunglasses, suncream and snacks are always readily available so it’s hard to want for anything…but we were still asked by David just incase!  We enjoyed a relaxing evening in the lounge consisting of exquisite canapés (the croque monsieur is very tasty) cocktails and generous glasses of wine. During this time Marlen was kind enough to help us recreate a photo we took nearly 6 years ago, we chatted with Ioanna and had an in-depth conversation about the icecream selection before finally deciding on black coconut and gin and tonic!  We both think you’ll be hard pushed to find a more comfortable bed than the ones at Hotel 41. We definitely had a great night’s sleep and enjoyed a lazy lie in before heading to breakfast.  After a more-than-filling breakfast (good luck deciding what to have!) where we were looked after by another David, it was finally time to check out. Throughout our stay, we could have requested ‘anything, any time’ via the button on our room phone but the most we ever desired were a couple of extra bottles of still water after an indulgent evening…and of course, these arrived within a couple of minutes on a tray to our room. If you’re looking for a weekend where you feel truly spoilt, look no further as you won’t be disappointed.…",5.0,Date of stay: September 2021,Hotel 41,3749,5.0,3473,197,58,16,5,0.0016597510373443983,September,2021

3073,320,Great stay at Hotel 41,"I felt compelled to write a review about my stay at Hotel 41. To be perfectly honest this is not my normal level of hotel as it is not cheap. It was a huge splurge for me and my granddaughter. The staff are tremendous as I was feeling a little intimidated, but they were all sweet and welcoming. I especially want to mention Adele who is so excellent in every aspect of her job from being open and friendly to problem management. Also, Esin is so warm and friendly. The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. Nice touches like turn down service with chocolate or a nice pillow spray. One night we sent to see Mary Poppins and they left a glowing message on the bathroom mirror when we got back hoping we enjoyed the show. Notes wishing us a good day..just little touches that put this Hotel over the top. The complimentary snacks and small plates are great! Complimentary Jude’s ice cream completely impressed my granddaughter!!…",5.0,Date of stay: May 2022,Hotel 41,3749,5.0,3473,197,58,16,5,0.0016597510373443983,May,2022

Lounge: the staff are very attentive and they will make sure that all your needs are taken care of. the food is exquisite, often in lounges, the food can be average however the food there was freshly made with lots of choices.

3079,320,Perfect 10,"Was I dreaming?...  Had the most amazing few days at Hotel 41 celebrating my birthday! From the moment I stepped foot into hotel 41, everything was a perfect 10.   A warm welcome in the lobby, and then greeted again with affection in the executive lounge and handed a glass of champagne, whilst hubby sipped a glass of merlot.  The room was cosy and clean, with a fire place and small seating area. All the expected amenities in a luxury 5 star pad, and added personal touches included a welcome letter, macaroons and birthday cake.  We enjoyed canapes and drinks before heading off to the cinema, returning to plunder the pantry with a bowl of hot chicken pie and salad, and naughty but nice desserts at midnight.  The turned down room awaited us, as the fire warmed our toes and we reflected on the day,  and looked forward to a second day of celebrations.  In the morning, I stretched my body into familiar yoga poses whilst looking up to the blue sky, the sun shining on my face, alone on the roof top of hotel 41...what a way to start my birthday!   A special breakfast hot chocolate with cream and a flake, followed by a full English breakfast, just how we like it, made for the perfect morning.   Off for some retail therapy at Harrods, a ten minute stroll away, the sun was beaming and we had the perfect base in London, central to all the places we wanted to visit.   We returned for another evening of canapes but this time, we sat on the intimate roof top and enjoyed the evening breeze before a fun night at the theatre and home to Hotel 41, what more could we want!   The pantry was stocked and waiting for us when we returned, the service  impeccable, a lovely way to end another great night on the town.    Another amazing morning with roof top Yoga, a filling breakfast and a complimentary later check out.   Top mark for customer service, for care and kindness, and for making my birthday so special.

Though this is not our typical level of hotel, not once did anyone make us feel like we didn’t belong. All staff bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. Rose petals and candles on the nightstands, a handwritten happy anniversary message on the mirror, a little something on the pillow every night….they know how to make you feel special.

The fact that so many of them stay and turnover seems low says a great deal about the hotel and the ethos of the owners. I understand this as my staff only tend to leave when they have to. This keeps a stability and clients/guests love stability when they’re frequent users of a service. This marks 41 out against others who may choose to declare themselves as 5 star.  3. We’re not quite at the point of having stayed in every room but we have been in a lot of them and they’re all great with enough individuality to make them each of their own kind.

3171,330,Lovely as ever!,"The Ritz has a very special place in our hearts. On this occasion we returned to celebrate our engagement and I proposed as we arrived at the hotel .   As expected we had another faultless stay. We made use of the Rolls Royce which is highly recommended and a lovely extra the hotel offers to its guests.   On arrival we were greeted by champagne and congratulations from head of concierge Michael De Cozar and other staff members. We then went to the stunning Rivoli bar and had some celebration drinks before being presented with a lovely gift from the hotel. We then tried out the world famous afternoon tea in the downstairs ballroom which was beautiful.   We later checked in with the helpful reception staff and we stayed in an executive suite overlooking Green Park. The room was located on the seventh floor and was beautiful and spacious.  There is nothing negative I can say about the stay. There are many 5* luxury hotels in London but what makes us return as often as we can is the unique beauty of the hotel, it really is spectacular. The lovely attentive staff are also the other reason, they are a credit to the hotel and made us feel incredibly at home during our stay.

3172,330,Room 217 Very Noisy,"Stayed here and we were allocated Room 217. The room looks nice but it was very noisy. It faced onto the road but the noise wasn’t coming from the traffic itself but it was coming from within the building. We constantly heard wheels of trolleys or wheels of suitcases being rolled on squeaky wooden floors. We couldn’t quite pin point if the sound was coming from above us or next to us but it was constant. Squeaky floor boards and constant rolling of wheels on wooden floors, it was non-stop. We stayed in this room for 4hrs while waiting to go down to dinner and that entire time the noise never stopped. We could also hear vacuuming nearby and a woman screaming in the throes of passion at 4pm. The only respite from cacophony of noise from the constant rolling of wheels on squeaky floorboards was when we left the room. Needless to say if you are a light sleeper like myself then avoid this room and request a quiet room. Also, although the room looks nicely decorated it was however, showing it’s age which can be clearly seen in the bathroom (see attached photos).…",3.0,Date of stay: February 2022,The Ritz London,5148,4.5,4203,601,186,78,80,0.06721991701244813,February,2022

We came here for afternoon tea, and from arrival we felt very welcome and all our nerves were put at ease right away by the kind man on the door. We ate I the ballroom, which was beautiful. We were serenaded by a pianist and delighted to so many wonderful sandwiches and cakes. The sandwiches were refilled as was the tea. We spent two hours here and didn't feel rushed at all. It gave us the chance to take it all in and enjoy it. Staff were friendly and polite and didn't make us feel inferior due to the setting at all- something I was worried would happen having ready reviews on here suggesting they did.

Sadly it just was no where near as good. Firstly we were not in the Palm court and the room we were in was just not as nice. The Hotel itself is amazing and you go partly for the experience  but did feel a bit rushed . The cake selection was poor and the scones just didn’t taste or look like scones , all disappointing  and tried to over Charge us which they had to correct , we travelled from Bham  too so all added to the cost which for £67 for the afternoon tea  and £7 for a small glass coke , we know it’s London but even that is ridiculous  , we felt it all somewhat overpriced for what you get, We won’t be going again which is a shame but much better options about .…",3.0,Date of stay: May 2022,The Ritz London,5148,4.5,4203,601,186,78,80,0.06721991701244813,May,2022

3178,330,An incredible 50th birthday stay,"I don't know where to begin, but I've just experienced a stay like no other here at The Ritz hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday.  My sister and I stayed for 2 nights in Room 617 which had a wonderful view right over Piccadilly. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The huge bathroom was luxurious and spotless. There was a full sized bath, 2 sinks, bidet and a huge separate walk in shower.  We had booked afternoon tea on our arrival day which was just wonderful. The food and staff were fantastic. We enjoyed champagne and took in the ambience of the pianist. They bought out a little birthday cake for me. On our first evening we took a stroll down through Green Park and saw the start of the Jubilee Celebration preparations taking place down The Mall. Filled with Union Jacks it looked stunning.   We had room service breakfast which was delicious and plentiful. We then headed over to London Victoria as we had a day trip booked on the British Pullman Train. We got back to the hotel around 5pm and had booked drinks in The Rivoli Bar that evening. It was wonderful. The next morning, we took breakfast in the restaurant, and again, the staff were so friendly and attentive. Another fabulous breakfast. We didn't have to check out until midday which was really nice.  Huge shout-out goes to Ally on reception who really looked after us. This stay had been a long time in the planning (and saving) and it absolutely exceeded all my expectations. Thank you so very much to you all.

From the moment we arrived at The Ritz in our taxi the experience was superb. Doorman opened our taxi door, collected our bags from the taxi and took them away. We were shown to reception by a very polite attendant. Check in was smooth and efficient. The receptionist was very polite and asked if we wanted a tour of the establishment - such fun!

This time around we decided to go to the Friday Night Live Dinner Dance, and it was an incredible experience. The entertainment was spot-on and faultless, and the food was delicious as always. This is something that you should definitely try to do if you can, as it is such a memorable experience that will stay with you for years to come.

Myself and a friend had waited 5 months for this afternoon tea experience and were very much let down. The atmosphere, room and crockery were lovely however the sandwiches were very basic, dry and tasteless. I have had better sandwiches from the local petrol garage. The cakes were only OK, again very basic. The scones were nice. I expected so much more from the ritz. Always happy to pay above my means for an experience but £95 for a Champaign afternoon tea is crazy when what was served was so disappointing. Wouldn’t recommend the afternoon tea.

3276,340,Good hotel. Not as good as other Mont Calms. ,"Had a great few nights at this hotel and reluctantly gave it 4/5 for a few minor things that added up down to one word 'communication'.   When we arrived to check in, we were stood around waiting for a good few minutes before Chris came and sorted us out. There were staff at reception doing 'stuff' but we were even acknowledged. As soon as Chris walked through, he saw us, stopped what he was doing, and then checked us in.   The room was clean and tidy, but the furniture a little dusty. Also there was no shampoo/ conditioner in our first night, but this was sorted the following day.   Breakfast was fine - buffet style or room service, but it was annoying that we were asked each day how we were paying (we'd pre-booked it and it was part of our room) so why did we get asked each day (by the same guy too)? Apparently there was a 'glitch' in the system!!  We had a meal one night at the hotel. This was really nice and the waiter was really good. He was the only one there though and seemed to be rushing around everywhere. I felt a bit sorry for him as it did seem quite busy.   We also used the spa benefit that we had as part of our club room booking, but this caused a slight issue.   Firstly, you need to book this 72 hours in advance, yet we were never told this at either booking or check-in. So when we went to book, they said they would 'squeeze' us in. Which they did. Confirmed it by email, text and phone call, only for us to then get a message that morning saying it has been moved back by an hour due to us not confirming the booking!! Hang on, we did.... Three times!!  This was finally sorted and I must say that that session was amazing. It's only a spa pool but the deep tissue I had, and the Swedish massage enjoyed by my wife, were both our of this world!!  We are very fond and frequent visitors of Mont Calm hotels, but feel slightly disappointed by this one, and so won't be brave again by trying something new, and instead stick to the ones we've been to before. …",4.0,Date of stay: June 2022,The Chilworth London Paddington,1493,4.5,1242,143,60,22,26,0.06804979253112033,June,2022

3371,350,Home away from Home,"We happened upon The Kensington after some rather bad luck with another hotel in the area. Upon arrival to The Kensington my family was very stressed and worn out after a rotten first day in London. That all changed as soon as we told reception of our incredible bad luck. From that moment on every staff member went above and beyond to make us feel not only comfortable but very well cared for. What I came to learn after a couple of days is that this is the standard of care here. The overall vibe of the hotel is cozy and welcoming. The decor is nothing short of amazing and the history of the building is quite interesting. The rooms are very clean and roomy. The head of concierge, Emiliano Del Pizzo and his staff went above and beyond to secure some stressful loose ends for us, with Emiliano taking it upon himself to follow up after we had checked out. I cannot say enough about our stay other than I will be back next summer!…",5.0,Date of stay: June 2022,The Kensington,3965,4.5,3127,646,136,37,19,0.016597510373443983,June,2022

The feeling of this place being what I call a “step above” starts when you first walk on the property.  The hotel is beautiful, clean and just has a great vibe. The hotel is perfectly located near two tube stops and museums, so easy to get to just about anywhere from here.  We arrived very early into Heathrow from JFK, so in no way did we think any of the two rooms we booked  would be ready, certainly not before noon!  I will say that after being up for 20 hours it was great to have a hotel manger who went out of his way  way to get us into one of our rooms for a little rest. The second room was adjoining and private, so even better. Team work and caring staff, what can I say! They all know what they are doing and do it with a smile! Best In London!!

3375,350,Sadly disappointed,"We had such high hopes for this hotel as our travel agent and the website both showed gorgeous images of the common spaces and rooms. We arrived very early after a long flight and just wanted to refresh. The hotel staff checked us in, gave us a key and off we went with no explanation of the room or where things are in the hotel. Our room was on the third floor, dark, dated and the finishes were worn down and not maintained. It was very disappointing as we spent a lot for the rooms. They offered a new room but it had a very loud machine noise. We chose to remain in our room for the night and ultimately booked a new hotel for the remaining two nights of our trip, sadly losing our money. This is of course our personal experience and does not reflect on the other rooms as we can’t speak for them. The common spaces are well kept of course. The staff, friendly, but didn’t go out of their way to remember seeing us before. I wish I could give a better review.

The level of service was unmatched - the concierges had excellent recommendations and the porters even asked about how our evenings were the day before and remembered what our plans were.

The beds and linens are comfortable, our room had a tub big enough to soak in…the turn down service is top notch with everything from coffee, bottles waters, shortbreads, clean towels, etc being re-stocked…and it goes on and on…we stayed for a week and it wasn’t long enough.

George welcomed us back, tho’ how he recognised us wearing masks I’ll never know! We checked in early and Barbara sorted lunch for us while we waited for our room.  The star of the show for us was Tom! He brought birthday treats for the birthday girl, even offering to sing Happy Birthday to her! He’s such a joy to talk to and just made us feel so welcome.

We had an issue with our original room selection - no fault of the hotel's but one of the rooms we reserved was unoccupable - but Yannick and Anita at the front desk were extremely helpful and agreeable and made sure we were happy.   George the doorman quickly got to know us and was particularly helpful.  The rooms were very nice, but not beyond what you would expect in this price range. However, the common areas were incredible.

3470,360,Terrible after service and consideration to extraordinary circumstances,"Unfortunately despite the nice rooms and roof top bar (Waterloo) - I was unable to make use of the facilities due to ending up in hospital due to an incident. I returned in the morning at 11.15 let into my room -  and reminded checkout was at 12. I was in a sling, and bruised all over. I understand this is not related to the hotel itself; but no accommodation for even credit towards a future visit - and despite booking a birthday package which was not delivered; I'm now struggling to get that refunded as they wish me to email them my bank details which I refuse, and somehow unable to just refund the card on which the room was booked and paid for.

We didn't try the Sky Bar but wish we had. This was the only bar/restaurant open in the evenings during our stay.  Breakfast was fabulous. Even though it was free with the deal we had booked I'd definitely pay for it when staying again, and I don't often say that! There was so much choice, it was all fresh and tasty. They even had a breakfast dessert station with profiteroles, apple tart, churros and waffles, which I simply had to try!

Rang reception 4 times and no-one came up to speak to them.  I suspect they were selling drugs from the room as people would knock on the door (no staying in the room) then were gone within 5 mins.  Reception said as it was a weekend the manager would have to be emailed and would refund me for the night (we stayed 2 and happy to pay for the 2nd) but had pre-paid - I can see why they insist on this now.  The manager took repeated emails and messages to even respond then refused to even refund part of it.  Only offered a small discount off a future stay.

We made our own bed (of course I can do that myself!), had the same towels for 3 nights and therefore had to ensure they were dried by hanging them all over the room; not a great hardship I know) and we replenished our own milk etc. All for the Covid cause, but should have asked for a reduction in the room rate really.

Conveniently located near to Lambeth North station on the Bakerloo line I can be at my office in under 25 minutes, door to door.

Breakfast was average for a buffet breakfast.  Very helpful staff.

Myself and partner booked a double room for Valentine’s Day.   We arrived early and told our room was no longer double due to too many bookings.

The beds literally MOVED EVERYWHERE when you even sat on them! Even a slight move when we were asleep sent the beds flying into the corner window!! WHY wouldn’t you have stoppers for this?

I was told this couldn’t be done and that I would have to contact Booking.Com . I did this and amended my reservation to include 2 guests per double room . I then had email from H10 to confirm this and to also confirm the final price (which was the same as the original price I booked for)  I then made another call to H10 who confirmed all was ok.

3571,370,This Christmas stopover was perfect,"Stayed for Christmas l, arrive by train at Waterloo so the location is perfect for me, I was upgraded to a family suit which was extremely kind.    The hotel feels high end without the high end price tag, the beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. The staff very helpful and friendly. The pool feels luxurious and is a great temperature. Breakfast was buffet style the plates were heated so your breakfast stayed warm and an egg station, so the eggs are cooked fresh to order, I personally would rather have everything cook to order, I’m sure that way there would be a lot less waste.     I would like to see something happening in the area that used to be used for the executive lounge, I always liked to use it. It’s a great space with lovely views of Big Ben and Westminster bridge. Such a waste.   My last three stop overs at this hotel left doubts about staying again, (July 21, the tennis event stopped us using the hotel to its full potential. August 21, there was an awful smell in our room, which I reported and was told someone from the hotel would contact me they didn’t. September 21, due to COVID restrictions the pool numbers are restricted which meant our party of seven on this occasion could not swim together as they couldn’t fit us in) but this time it redeemed itself, the hotel was clean, we felt welcomed, and I really enjoyed staying here for Christmas, I’m so glad I give it another chance.…",5.0,Date of stay: December 2021,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,23336,4.5,13272,6172,2041,1022,829,0.3269709543568465,December,2021

3574,370,Large Rooms and Great Staff,"We arrived to our hotel before 3pm. The front desk tried to find us a room for early check-in but one was not available. They gladly stored our luggage and we went downstairs to the restroom to freshen up. The concierge desk was extremely helpful; every time. The Illy Cafe was great for a quick breakfast and coffee in the morning. When you first enter the hotel, you are greeted by security and must take the escalator to the lobby. The hotel is at the very end of Westminster bridge. You are pretty much between Waterloo and Westminster underground.  When we checked-in, we noticed the room was warm and one of the outlets next to the bed was broken. We called down to the front desk and they sent an engineer who acknowledged they knew the outlet was broken but did nothing to fix it and he said the AC was working fine (it never got very cold).  The room was very large and gave us plenty of room. The carpets need a good cleaning as do the surface of the desk and small table. Even though they said housekeeping would come every 3 days, they came everyday…we were very happy about that!  We stayed for 6 days and can say, we were quite happy. The staff was fantastic with every question and request. I was surprised by how large the room and bathroom was (even the bathtub).

However, breakfast felt like mass catering in a massive souless room and did not live up to the premium feel the rest of the hotel is going for. The variety of food does not compare to other similar hotels we have stayed in. Our main problem though was the lack of allergy awareness from the staff. We asked about the ingredients of a few things (sausages and bread) but were told that they just couldn't guarantee the absence of allergens. The sausages were produced off site so they couldn't tell me what was in them! Not only did this feel very discriminatory it meant the options were limited for my son.

The balcony overlooks the London eye and Big Ben if its a special occasion, this is the suite to book. It overlooks the Presidential suite, so in my view, is a slightly better choice.  Room service food was pretty average - with so many great restaurants around id probably recommend just heading out instead.  One thing to watch out for - taxis are extortionate from here, simply because when they pick you up from the Hotel, they then need to do a massive loop to get going again in the right direction, so you are 5-10 quid even before you have went anywhere.

We found this hotel by comparing multiple brands in the area. This one is centurally located between: Big Ben, Tower Bridge, SOHO, and the Beckingham Palace. We got a good workout in by walking to all those places but there are other options too.  It was a short walking getting off the underground from the airport also! (About 10 minutes) and we also were bringing out rollerboards with us.  The room was cozy, with some pretty cool tech. They have bluetooth speakers that you can hook up to in the room and it plays over the speakers in the ceiling.

Wow I have never seen such an impressive reception area. Look up and see the skylight tunnel 9 floors above. The lighting display across all the whole area was amazing and when I commented on it the chap behind reception changed the display to show what could be shown. It was like an underwater experience.   The rooms were faultless and there was absolutely nothing you could want that wasn’t provided. Everything was there, in the right place and accessible. The double sinks, double shower heads, smart room control screen by the beds, turndown service and room moved into “evening mode” with soft lighting and chill music through the sound system. It was faultless and thoroughly enjoyable to be in there. There was no noise from rooms above or to the side which meant a very quiet sleep. Everything in the room had COVID sanitised stickers on from the coffee machine, mini bar, toiletries and even the tubs of popcorn.   Breakfast is served at the radio rooftop restaurant on the 10th floor and was excellent. Service was attentive but not intrusive and food excellent quality.   An indication of a good hotel is the staff that remember your name. This happened all over the hotel from the restaurant team to the concierge desk. The concierge team were excellent, arranging a battery charger for our camera, restaurant bookings and always on hand with brollys etc with the wet weather. Walk in with shopping bags, they will take them straight off you, suggest a drink and the bags are taken to your room.   The hotel is very trendy and modern - but sumptuous and  comfortable with the black, silver and grey theme running throughout.

So this time, as a belated b'daygift for my husband, I surprised him with a stay in this hotel.   We were kinda early to check in but that was no problem. We even got upgraded to an executive room on the 11th floor. So I was happy. The room had a beautiful view over the city.  But now the cons: ✩ There was one lift out of order. But nobody knew because it was on the ground floor, but the doors just didn't open. At one point, there was another lift at the ground floor as well. People were waiting for lift to go up, but both stayed closed. Probably the liftsystem was trying to open the broken lift first. When I figured this out I told the staff and they did take care of it. The day I had to check out, the middle lift wasn't working properly as well. Stayed open, didn't move untill we pressed the button multiple times. ✩The breakfast was the most disappointing of all. There wasn't much choice: I missed more choices of bread, more fruit and vegetables, smoked salmon, the option to order omelettes etc. Pretty basic for a Novotel.

However, the room was not cleaned either on the day of arrival or at any other stage during our three day stay. Towels were not changed and we ran out of toilet roll. Reception said they would deliver toilet roll but none had arrived after four hours so we eventually went in search of housekeeping ourselves. There was no complimentary water in our fridge and tea and coffee were not replenished. The breakfast food was satisfactory, however certain foods ran out and were not replenished.

The room was large and the bed was comfortable. There were a few marks on the carpet etc but nothing too terrible. We added breakfast on for a couple of mornings, which was really nice but a little pricey. One thing to note was the hotel bar staff were extremely rude, after we stood being ignored for 5 minutes even though there was no one else waiting, we decided to go to the Albie down the road instead, where we were immediately served! Definitely an area for improvement. The air con was also a bit hit and miss, which wasn’t a problem in April but would put me off returning during the summer months.

The rooms were really clean with nice decor. The bathroom was spacious with a good-sized shower. The beds were much firmer than I am used to but I still slept got a great night’s rest. We requested a quiet room so we were given a room at the end of the hallway which was sectioned off with a 2nd external door. This was brilliant and very helpful.

Brilliant pool, we'd expected considering the popularity of slots that there would be others but for around 45 mins of the 1 hour slot myself and my 2 children (3 and 14) were the only ones in the pool which was great.

The breakfast buffet was very good (a ""little"" cramped ish) and the elevators were very fast, the sauna was great, the hotel level we stayed on was very (internally) quiet.   Now, the not as good parts. We had some issues around getting fresh towels and toilet paper during our stay,  (The manager has since done all she could in her power to make us feel better about the situation though, which is good on her part, cause most hotels just ignore any complaints, hoping they'll just go away).

The negatives: the other parts of the room could have been cleaner. As in there was a scrunchy under a table, hair on the bed, the coffee cups while ""clean"" had accumulated a layer of dust. We understood the room would be cleaned only on request, which is fine, but when we requested a refresh of the water/coffee/cups at 9am, it hadn't happened by 3pm.

We'd ordered a superior family room and had made the hotel aware that we were bringing our friends daughter so would need a large room for privacy. Safe to say the room was not superior and I've paid less at more extravagant hotels in London. The bathroom had a window which was frosted granted but you could still see the person in the shower, meaning we had to leave the room in order to give the girls their privacy (a cost we weren't prepared for) when we unpacked I discovered there were no drawers and very little storage for 4 people, this room…",1.0,Date of stay: August 2021,Novotel London Blackfriars,3337,4.5,1765,1203,250,75,44,0.24149377593360996,August,2021

I was surprised when our room wasn't cleaned after our first day out, which is normal for any hotel anywhere I have ever stayed. Reception were friendly when I questioned this and gave us more towels and toilet roll, telling us rooms are now only cleaned on request. Well, we had already requested new towels and toilet rolls but absolutely nothing happened, so we gave up asking.

The hotel was clearly short on staff and we saw that as soon as we arrived at 15.00 on Monday with a long queue  at check in and people getting stressed over waiting for their rooms to be ready, the problem was the hotel was short of housekeeping staff and rooms were taking a long to come available. But the staff were brilliant, trying their best to get people in to their room. We went into the bar and a coffee and a snack.

This sounded perfect so I booked.  It turns out that the staff have no idea how many people are in the pool during these so called slots. A family of 45 can enter using one card and stay for 10 hours if they wish. There were about 4 large families when we got there and I decided I was too uncomfortable to even get in the pool. My brother went in the pool for about 5 mins and realised it was impossible to swim around so many people so we left.

Very central and good walking or cheap cab distance to the Thames and other attractions. It was a birthday celebration and our bed was decorated with sweets, balloons and confetti (cheap and cheesy but a cute touch!), and a birthday card. The room was excellent value for money- at a time when London was very quiet with few tourists it was great to have a room with a big balcony overlooking The Shard. This room would normally be very expensive but we got it at a good price.  Our suite had clearly been newly refurbished. There’s not a lot of character but it’s all about the view and cleanliness.

No white bread for toasting it seems at breakfast time, but Lucy and Mariela made sure that they had some for me day 2 and 3, things like this are above and beyond in my opinion.

The room was clean and the bathroom was modern.  We had drinks at the Lynaess bar which was fab, the service, drinks and vibe was amazing and we had a great time.  The issue we had was in the evening we came back quite late to find the door of the hotel closed and locked. As we had come in from the back entrance we assumed this was the only entrance to the hotel. There were no signs or number to call, we were naturally very worried and only by luck the cleaner inside told us to go around the hotel to the front.  I wasnt happy as all it took was a note to be placed at the entrance advising guests where they should go if the door is locked. This is not good and also more impritant not safe for any guests.  We opted for breakfast and we were absolutely disappointed with the food. It was cold and tasteless, the tea and coffee served was also very cold.

Room only gets to 25 so our first night we were really cold as room took a while to get up to temp from the default setting  Room service menu can only be accessed by a QR code from the TV and one of our TV's didn't work so that was a bit of time wasted - how hard is it to put…",3.0,Date of stay: April 2022,Sea Containers London,5550,4.5,4040,1032,303,102,73,0.09211618257261411,April,2022

Situated between St James Park and Westminster tube stations, you are well situated to visit some of the most common landmarks in London ( Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, London Eye).   All of the reception staff we dealt with were helpful and polite and we were able to check in before 3pm and store our luggage on the day we left without any issues. The room is small but well fitted and provided comfortable sleeping and shower facilities for the weekend. We had no intention of spending much time in our room, so the size really didn't bother us.  Food wise, the evening meals on offer consist of a curry, a chilli and/ pizza - not much selection at all!! The breakfast was a let down and I don't feel it was worth the £7.99 per person we paid. A full English does not consist of sausage, bacon, beans and scrambled egg :-(   Overall, I'd highly recommend if you want somewhere located centrally and you are not too bothered about room sizes or views from your hotel window.

The hotel was ideally located within easy walking distance of the Mall, Westminster and central London, with good access to nearby tube stations (St James' Park tube station is a two-minute walk). Upon arrival, we were not expecting such a small room (110) but the modern, efficient use of the space lent itself to a comfortable stay. No tea/coffee available in-room but free provision of such  in the ground floor lounge - this caused a little irritation when having to encounter queuing for tea/coffee and/or lack of mugs!

Room was comfortable though did get stuffy at times - quick blast if the air conditioning solved that though.  No noise from outside of hotel and very little from inside.

Everything you would expect from a Premier Inn, but in a compact version. Rooms were clean and comfy, staff incredibly friendly and helpful.  Two minor points which detract from the otherwise perfect stay. Our rooms didn't have a window which opened so it could get quite stuffy and meant the air conditioning had to be turned on.

Also only one flat pillow was provided for each of us and no others are in the room so we asked for more only to be told there were non to be had as they were all in use.

I think the pictures do a great job of conveying the idea that this hotel is a ""no-frills"" experience and the size of the room is a little small, so I think they portray themselves very accurately. The room was perfect for 2 people. We were a little cramped for space, but this was a negligible problem at most. The only thing that we would have wanted was better quality soap/shampoo.

Breakfast is pretty bad, even considering the price. Huge queue at breakfast every single morning, often no tableware available and limited amount of food & drinks.

If you are here to doing some site seeing this is a great hotel to stay for value for money. The room are small and no access to any windows that open so it can get very stuffy but if it’s somewhere to rest you here I would definitely recommend.

4371,450,What a location,"We had been given a present for afternoon tea for 2 at the ritz and decided to make it a two night stay in London. We only live 8 miles away but I felt like I was on holiday in another city as I have never done the London sightseeing before.  The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the London eye, we travelled up by train to Waterloo station and it's about a 5 or 6 minute walk from there. The staff who greeted us were very friendly and professional and we booked the dinner/breakfast deal for one night and morning. We went to our room on the 6th floor (premier plus room) and we were delighted how fresh and modern it felt, a really lovely bathroom with shower only, coffee machine, fridge, ironing board/iron and the view was looking directly at the London eye. The only criticism i have is the bed, we have a very large bed at home and thought we would have a queen or king size but it was only a double, but we slept fine all the same as there was no noise to disturb us throughout our stay. The dinner  was excellent and very reasonably priced, and once again the staff couldn't do enough for you and work very very hard. The breakfast in the morning was absolutely delicious and piping hot  which is how I like it and there was a huge selection. As we were having afternoon tea that evening we had a very good breakfast which kept us going until 5.30. We then became tourists for the day and explored all the nearby attractions, Big Ben, horse guards parade, Downing Street, Buckingham palace watching the changing of the guard then back through st James's park, it was a fantastic day and London was heaving and this was only a Monday. Sorry about the long winded review but all I can say is this was a perfect hotel to eat sleep and be right in the heart of a fabulous city which when you see on foot is right up there with other major cities. Just book the premier inn county hall and you won't be disappointed.…",5.0,Date of stay: March 2022,Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,10285,4.5,5781,3313,790,217,184,0.24315352697095435,March,2022

The location was/is perfect and was so close to everything we needed. It was my mums birthday so I rang before and asked for a room with a view. We got an amazing view of the London eye thank you so much, we even got to check in an hour early!   With the windows open the room was quite I mean it wasn’t completely silent by any means but it wasn’t as loud as we were originally thought it was going to be. The room was clean and so was the bathroom. The best part was we booked a twin room and to our surprise we got two double beds usually we get a single/sofa bed and then a double or king so this was really nice.  Our room wasn’t serviced during our stay but that was fine as we didn’t need anything anyway. We were able to request toilet paper and extra tea at reception easily.   Breakfast was lovely they handled my mum with her gluten free toast/porridge nicely. The only think I would suggest is booking a table because even though we had a table booked for 8:30 we didn’t actually get sat down at a table until 8:40/45 so if you didn’t book a table I’m guessing you would have got turned away as this wait happened on two of the mornings we had breakfast.   I really liked the fact that the lift could only be operated with a key card, from a safety standpoint especially because next time I come it will be a solo trip.   All the staff we encountered were lovely especially the gentleman who served us for our evening meals (so sorry we forget their name).  If anyone is thinking about staying in London and needs to be in this area I highly recommend.

The staff never crack a smile and are slow and uninterested. There is nowhere to sit. ( I saw a woman and her child sitting on a window sill).  My room, to put it mildly, was ‘tired’. Skirting coming away from the wall, paint chipped and missing and yellowing everywhere on every surface. My pillow was so flat as to not worth being called a pillow. The TV was stuck at an angle so as to make it unwatchable - I couldn’t move it upright.

Hotel staff were excellent and even though I arrived early (just before midday) I was allowed into my room 10 minutes later. Very clean room, with decent toiletries in the bathroom.  I had been upgraded from a single to a double. The room was nicely laid out. Concealed in one of the wardrobes was a sink, coffee machine, kettle and plenty of pods, powdered coffee and tea.  The bed was comfy - lots of pillows, cushions and a throw. I slept like a baby. Albeit a 14 stone baby. When I returned to the hotel after the ballet, I enjoyed a glass from the complimentary bottle of red wine left in the room. Decent wine too!

After a hectic day due to tube strikes, I was glad to get to this hotel with a beautiful entrance and warm reception.

4560,469,Highly recommended,This was a last minute booking and there was only one small double room left which was very small indeed but it was very clean and had everything we needed for one night. We were going to a show at the Royal Albert Hall and it was very well located for that. Our room was at the front of the building but the street was quiet. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downside was the room price which is always too high but if you want anything decent in London and you haven't booked months in advance and you want something a bit different from a Premier Inn then you have to pay over the odds.

4571,470,A lovely place to stay in Bloomsbury,"I have stayed at The Montague on the Gardens four times, and can confidently say I will be there again in April. This has become “my hotel”in London is for many reasons. The staff are welcoming and attentive, with a level of service typical of other Red Carnation Hotels in London , but the Montague has that special friendliness that’s difficult to describe. As a solo or with my husband, my experiences have always been positive.  The public rooms are varied and offer several places to sit and have conversations, read, or enjoy tea or a drink. My favourite is The Leopard Bar. I am particularly happy to see the work done on the garden room during the past quiet times, and look forward to having afternoon tea there in the spring.  Whether  you are speaking with a concierge, housekeeping, restaurant , or bar staff,  anything you require help with is met with enthusiasm and efficiency.   The area is excellent as it is close to so much ; The British Museum is around the corner. My favourite pastime while there is strolling through Russell Square , which is at the end of Montague Street.  Each room I have stayed in has had a different decor, always beautiful, and super comfortable. All have been quiet, whether facing the street or the gardens.  Make this “your hotel” in London.

Hotel staff - administration, concierge, restaurants, waiters/waitresses, and housekeepers - were pleasant, went above the call of duty and treated our family with an agreeableness to serve.  Although having younger kids felt a little out-of-place at a boutique hotel with a lot of couples or older adults on holiday/vacation/business trips, the staff was so accommodating and engaging.

Worse still, when I mentioned this as we were leaving, the staff apologised and then presented me with a final room bill which included a £10 'service charge'.

It is about a 10 minute walk from Euston and we were greeted with a warm welcome by all the staff on arrival.

From check-in to check-out, the Montague just gets everything quietly and classily right. The decor is lovely, preserving beautifully the Georgian townhouse history and atmosphere. The rooms are elegant and supremely comfortable. The bar is a fab place to relax, with great wine, cocktail and food options (personal favourite, the ace chickpea and beetroot burger). Breakfast is an absolute delight, with food cooked to order always done splendidly. Then there are the little flourishes that mean so much - the handwritten welcome card, the delicious cookies and shortbread.

We were allowed to book in 90 minutes early as our room was ready. We were given a tour of the ground floor and the amenities by the receptionist, the bar-person later gave a tour of the Ski-Lodge [between being a Ski Lodge and Beach Bar], and I was left with the impression we were not alone. The room was lovely, the live music in the Leopard Bar very welcome later. The food was excellent, in all it was impossible to fault.

Our room (double with queen size bed) was small but had everything in it you would want, and the housekeeping staff kept it lovely for us.

Wasn’t sure what to expect, however this has become the hotel that we will use every time we come back to the UK. I like the unique design elements, food, etc., but what sets the hotel apart from every other hotel is the staff. The staff are AMAZING. From reception to management, and in particular the bar staff…Antonia, Morgan, and Abilash…were a highlight of our trip. The personal attention, kind and friendly conversation, and even keeping the bar open later than normal so my husband could drink a few more pints.

We didn't hear from them regarding the table afterwards, and didn't bother to ask again. The bathroom had the smallest sink we've ever seen, and it was so low on the wall, you had to sit on knees to was your face, furthermore, you couldn't fill bottles or the kettle, since the faucet was so close to the sink. The breakfast buffet was fine but had a bit of a boring selection.  The staff was mostly nice and  helpful. Location is brilliant, as it's 5 minutes walk from Bayswater & Queensway st.

4677,480,For me the best hotel in London,"I have been coming to this hotel for years now when I go to London. The hotel itself is neat, the staff is very friendly and the high is well maintained. In addition, the location is perfect! Close to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and on Bayswater road you can quickly get on line 94 to Oxford Street. The hotel is close to Hyde Park for a lovely walk and yet the hotel is located on a small and quiet park. Around the hotel are a large number of fantastic restaurants of all kinds. Traditional Chinese, Indian, Italian and a lovely English pub. On my trips to London, I like to arrive early and leave late. You can store your luggage for free in the hotel, so you don't have to lug it around for a day. Speaking of which, if you come to London by Eurostar, you will depart again via St. Pancras station. Via Baywater tube station it is a few stops and you are on St. Pancras. A metro trip of another 20 minutes. In short, a hotel I enjoy coming to and will continue to come to for years to come!…",5.0,Date of stay: April 2022,London House Hotel,3009,4.0,977,1497,356,104,75,0.35435684647302906,April,2022

4679,480,Don’t stay here,"I booked a 4 day 3 night stay in this hotel. Paid 19.95 x2 for check in early and check out early and 80 for breakfast for the both of us. I got charged immediately to my credit card. When I got there they had some receipt saying the only charged 414£ which was false and I even showed her my credit card statement showing what was actually charged. I eventually quit arguing with her because I can just file a dispute with my card. Then we get to the room and it is TINY!  And the bathrooms you can’t even turn around it, it is quite terrible. Then there were 2 of us and they only allowed us 1 key, (we could PAY for another) and that’s how the lights work, so if one of us wanted to leave the room the other had to go without lights in the bathroom. THESE WALLS ARE THIN and the cleaning people are so LOUD. I couldn’t sleep in because they will constantly be banging in the next room. Then every morning we went to breakfast I had to CONSTANTLY tell them I already paid and we would have to argue with them then the manager would have to come down and say we paid, EVERY. SINGLE. MORNING. And on the last day the cleaning people came into our room 4 times trying to clean when we PAID FOR 2 PM CHECK OUT. We told that to them multiple times and they said they weren’t told that so we ended up just leaving out of annoyance.  The only positive I can say about this hotel is the outside is very London feeling and it is close to shops and 2 train stations. I will NEVER EVER stay here again. It is overpriced for the poor service and terrible rooms.  1 more thing, if you don’t listen to me and still book here DONT waste money on the breakfast. You get bread, 4 plain cereals, croissants and some nasty ass muffins to pick from and then a weird “cold” bar with some whole tomatoes ham and cheese and hard boiled eggs. Sometimes they threw bananas out there, 13 dollars a day for that breakfast. Good luck!!…",1.0,Date of stay: April 2022,London House Hotel,3009,4.0,977,1497,356,104,75,0.35435684647302906,April,2022

I went down to Reception twice and was told on each occasion it would be sorted - it wasn’t. No apology, no explanation, and of course no compensation.   We all understand that things go wrong - that isn’t the point. Even a three-star property needs to live up to certain standards, or at least fess up when it’s fallen short on the basics.

They paid £890 for 4 nights in a triple room with breakfast, and were told by LHH this month they had to use the booking or lose it. Although my husband, baby and I live just 2 hours away in South London, we decided it would be a nice getaway after a tough year.

Our room, No. 101, was also very clean with plenty of clean towels for us on our arrival. The room was perfect for us with nice view onto gated gardens. The shower was always hot and the room, which was a little cramped, suited us perfectly.

The description of a small double room is accurate and apt it is certainly compact in fact there is no space for a bedside table and the bed is flush against two walls.  The bed was comfortable and we both had a very snug and cozy nights sleep.  The room was spotlessly clean.

We had requested an early check in via email a few days before travel as usually this is not until 4pm. Though it couldn’t be guaranteed we were advised to see when we arrived. The hotel  is very large & modern with seemingly acres of glass in the central atrium area. The location - just moments from Blackfriars tube station and  St Paul’s Cathedral is great.  We arrived about 12:30pm & after speaking with reception we could have an early check in but the cost of this would be £40, which hadn’t been mentioned in our email. However a slightly earlier (3pm) check in was offered at no additional cost which was fine & gave us time to pop out for lunch.  On returning,  a very pleasant, helpful gentleman collected out luggage and escorted us across to the apartment section of the hotel - literally a couple of minutes walk. What a surprise awaited us on entry!!  Balloons, a handwritten card and complimentary drinks to mark our special occasion. An unexpected & very thoughtful touch. Thank you Leonardo.  Our 1st floor apartment was spacious with a huge (very comfy) bed, immaculate en suite shower room and a small kitchen area with fridge & microwave. There was crockery, cutlery & glasses for 2.  There was plenty of complimentary tea & coffee along with still & sparkling water.  A downside was being located right opposite building works. Not an issue in the day but they did disturb our first night as there was work going on until after midnight, which was very noisy. Thankfully our second night was fine but it might be helpful to let guests know in advance of this so it doesn’t come as a shock which it was for us.  We had breakfast at a small local business called L’Express City, which was just round the corner from our accommodation. Good range of choices, very reasonable prices & great coffee.  There are plenty of local and chain places to eat/drink within a few minutes walk so lots of options.  We used the facilities at the hotel’s Rena Spa daily and it was a real bonus to have access to these. The spa is great, with a good sized pool, large jacuzzi and steam/sauna rooms. The staff at Rena are lovely - very pleasant and friendly.  On our last night we spent a very relaxing couple of hours in the hotel’s lounge/bar area.

The air conditioning did not work at all and instead of just telling us that it doesn’t really work in London they gave us the loop around for three days, sent multiple mechanics to our room and then told us that we were doing it wrong. After the first night of just having the air blow into our room the ceiling was full of mouldy dust and covered the ceilings. One of the hotels solutions was to unlock our window and let fresh air in. He laughed and said the air doesn’t work and you’re not gonna get it fixed and its always like this. Besides that horrible situation, to call to the front desk to get a sheet or towels was a whole ordeal,the toilet didnt work the shower sprayer onto the floor and  our lights at midnight decided to flicker on and off and they’re connected by one light switch so every single light in our room flickered on and off all night long!!

A large group of us have been coming to the Grange St Pauls for many years but under new management, now called Leonardo St Paul’s they have definitely slipped.   I won’t go into too much detail other than to say that being stuck twice in a lift in one day and a bedroom where the temperate does not go lower than 27 degrees shows a lack of attention to the maintence basics. Bring stuck in a lift for 15 minutes is one thing but being told you will have to sleep in your 27 degree room for the night because there are no other rooms available is another!   You also get a sense that there are dozens of youngsters working here but no visible management. Don’t expect a call or even a manager to meet you at the desk if you have any problems.

At checkin Istvan, the head concierge, arranged to us to be swapped to a larger apartment which was much appreciated as we did have a lot of “stuff” with us. The apartment was excellent, bed very comfy and we did have a small sofa as well as a chair. Picking up on tips from other travellers I took washing up liquid and tea towels with me so we were able to breakfast and have snacks in our room. We did have a problem with a strobing light in our bathroom which took a while to resolve.

4867,499,Excellent service,"I recently visited Leonardo Royal spa facilities (Rena) and had the most amazing service allowing us to have a very relaxing break. First, we were met by Gabriela and Yoyahhia. They were very accommodating and helpful-no ask was too much. We then had a treatment which was the best I have had. Anna created a very calm and relaxing environment. We would recommend this place and will certainly be back.",5.0,Date of stay: May 2022,Leonardo Royal Hotel London St. Paul's,1130,4.0,655,172,91,102,115,0.2929460580912863,May,2022
4868,499,Pleasant stay and very friendly staff at the spa,"The room was as expected for the pedigree of the hotel; clean and exquisite. I enjoyed my stay but what stood out to me most was the spa staff, Ama, she was very welcoming and literally took me through what was available how to access them as such. Kudos to Ahmed and Claudia who helped with my onboarding and I am looking forward stay there again next time.",5.0,Date of stay: May 2022,Leonardo Royal Hotel London St. Paul's,1130,4.0,655,172,91,102,115,0.2929460580912863,May,2022
